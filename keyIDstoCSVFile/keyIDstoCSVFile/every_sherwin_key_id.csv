1, 1, " Renaissance","  Renaissance scholars emphasized reason, questioned authority, and pursued free inquiry. As the Renaissance directed attention to scientific matters, Europeans wanted to know more about the world’s size, shape, and people. The movement away from feudalistic societies to monarchies provided the unity, power, and resources needed to explore new lands, conquer existing civilizations, and colonize the land."
1, 2," Restoration","  The monarchy was restored in England after the rule of Cromwell. Charles II ascended to the throne in 1660. Colonization had halted during Cromwell’s rule but with Charles II, England began to build its empire again."
1, 3," Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (1394 – 1460)","  Though not an explorer himself, Henry sponsored voyages that sent Portuguese explorers down the west coast of Africa seeking trade, colonies, and an all-water route around Africa to the East.  In 1498 Vasco da Gama became the first to reach India by this route."
1, 4," Pre-Columbian Civilizations in North America","  North America was extremely diverse with over 200 languages spoken in what is now the United States. These linguistic differences often corresponded to cultural differences and contributed to the difficulties Native Americans had in coordinating a response to European encroachment. A tiny sampling of the vast cultural diversity—Aztecs and Maya in Central America developed sophisticated agricultural techniques of maize farming. In the Mississippi Valley the dominant tribes built permanent settlements marked by huge ceremonial mounds. The Pueblo Indians of the Southwest erected multistory buildings and constructed elaborate irrigation systems. The Iroquois of the Northeast organized a powerful and long-lasting military confederation."
1, 5," Native Americans and the Environment","  As native populations migrated and settled across North America over time, they developed distinct and increasingly complex societies by adapting to and transforming their diverse environments. As a result, there were over 500 tribes in what is now the United States. The spread of maize cultivation from present-day Mexico northward into the American Southwest and beyond supported economic development, settlement, advanced irrigation, and social diversification among societies. Examples: Hopi and Navaho tribes. Societies responded to the aridity of the Great Basin and the grasslands of the western Great Plains by developing largely mobile lifestyles. Examples: Cheyenne and Crow tribes. In the Northeast, the Mississippi River Valley, and along the Atlantic seaboard some societies developed mixed agricultural and hunter-gatherer economies that favored the development of permanent villages. Examples: Iroquois and Huron tribes. Societies in the Northwest and present-day California supported themselves by hunting and gathering, and in some areas developed settled communities supported by the vast resources of the ocean. Examples: Chinook and Coos tribes."
1, 6," The Columbian Exchange","  The transfer of animals, plants, people, culture, and diseases between the New and Old Worlds had a dramatic effect on both hemispheres. From the New World, Europe received many crops including corn, potatoes, and tobacco. Syphilis was a likely arrival from the New World as well. From the Old World, the Americas received horses, cattle, wheat, and rice. The introduction of diseases such as smallpox, measles, and cholera killed an estimated 90% of the Indian population."
1, 7," Treaty of Tordesillas","  In 1494 the Pope divided the lands of the New World between Spain and Portugal.  Spain took the lion’s share of the area, but Portugal received compensating territory in Africa and Asia as well as the title to the lands that would later be Brazil.  "
1, 8," Spanish Armada","  In 1588 Phillip II of Spain amassed a fleet of ships, financed by Spain’s New World gains, to invade England and defeat Protestantism. The Armada was quickly overwhelmed by the faster, smaller, more maneuverable, and more ably-manned English ships. This weakened the imperial aspirations of Spain, marked the beginning of England’s dominance of the world’s oceans, and provided the opening for English colonization. "
1, 9," The Black Legend","  This was the idea that Spaniards only tortured and butchered Native Americans, stole their gold, infected them with smallpox, and left misery behind.  Although they did exploit and kill many natives, the Spanish also intermarried and created a culture of mestizos—people of mixed Indian/European descent.  Spain transplanted culture, laws, religion, and language and laid the foundation for today’s Spanish-speaking nations of the Americas. "
1, 10," Encomienda System","  The encomienda was a grant from the Spanish crown, not of land, but of control over the native inhabitants. The Spanish landlord was entitled to tribute from the native inhabitants in the form of gold, crops, or labor.  The encomienda system was not slavery; the inhabitants could not be rented or sold. The landlord was to protect and Christianize the natives. But in practice, the natives were subject to harsh treatment and excessive demands for tribute."
1, 11," Juan de Sepulveda and Bartolome de las Casas—1550 ","  In a famous debate at the Spanish court Sepulveda and las Casas disputed whether Indians had souls. Sepulveda, arguing that they did not, said that the Indians were natural slaves and should be treated as such. Las Casas disagreed and persuaded King Charles V to uphold laws that attempted to reform the encomienda system (reforms which had limited effect). Las Casas, in order to protect the Native Americans, argued that African slaves should instead provide labor for the Spanish colonies, a position for which he later apologized. "
1, 12," The Spanish Mission System","  Leaving control of the Indians in the hands of civilians and soldiers as with the encomienda system of led to unfortunate results. The mission system combined native communities with supervision by Catholic priests and friars. The stated goal of the mission system was to Christianize the Indians and prepare them for assimilation into Hispanic society. Unfortunately, the temptation to use the Indians for forced labor often interfered with this goal."
1, 13," Juan de Oñate and the Acoma Rebellion—1598 ","  Oñate hoped to conquer what is now New Mexico for Spain and grant encomiendas to his followers. When he reached the Acoma Pueblo and announced that it was now subject to the king of Spain, Indians rebelled. Oñate crushed the rebellion, cutting off a foot from each man in the pueblo."
1, 14," Popé and the Pueblo Rebellion—1680","  Missions and encomiendas placed increasing burdens on the Pueblo Indians of present-day New Mexico. Prohibitions on the practice of traditional religions and excessive demands for tribute led Popé, a tribal spiritual elder, and others to lead a rebellion against Spanish rule. Although the Pueblos killed 400 Spaniards and destroyed many mission churches, by 1696 Spain regained control of the area."
1, 15,"Virginia Company","  The Virginia Company (a joint-stock company) received a charter from King James I of England for a settlement in the New World.  The Charter guaranteed settlers the same rights that they enjoyed at home; eventually this idea was extended to the other English colonies and became a cornerstone of American liberties."
1, 16," Joint-Stock Company","  A joint-stock company allowed a considerable number of investors to pool their capital. These companies provided the financial means to colonize the New World.  Each shareholder contributed some money to the company and received a proportionate share of the company’s profits or losses. Such a company was only intended to endure for a few years, after which the stockholders hoped to liquidate it for profit. This arrangement put extreme pressure on the colonists who were threatened with abandonment if they did not quickly strike it rich on the company’s behalf."
1, 17," Proprietary Colonies","  A colony that belonged to a proprietor, or owner. These were usually royal land grants.  Examples: Maryland (the first proprietary colony), Delaware, and Pennsylvania."
1, 18," Royal Colonies","  Such colonies were under the direct control of the king. Royal colonies had a governor and a governor’s council (upper house of colonial legislature) selected by the king. Eligible voters selected the lower house of colonial legislatures."
1, 19," John Rolfe","  English settler at Jamestown who married Pocahontas.  He imported to Virginia a new variety of tobacco, one more palatable to European tastes. This gave Virginia a valuable export and made Virginia an economically viable colony."
1, 20," Lord Baltimore","  He founded Maryland in 1634, partly for financial profit and partially to create a refuge for fellow Catholics whose religious worship was limited in Protestant England. When religious tension arose between Catholics and the more numerous Protestants, Baltimore drafted the Act for Religious Toleration (passed in 1649)."
1, 21," Walter Raleigh","  Inspired by the colonization efforts of his half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Raleigh organized a group of settlers who landed in 1585 on North Carolina’s Roanoke Island off the coast of Virginia.  With Raleigh busy at home, tensions grew with the local Indians and by the time a relief party arrived in 1591 the Roanoke colony had vanished, swallowed up by the wilderness. A favorite of Elizabeth I, he introduced tobacco and the potato to Europe. "
1, 22," James Oglethorpe","  Oglethorpe was a philanthropist who helped to found Georgia in 1733.  Oglethorpe became interested in prison reform after a friend died in debtor’s prison, and he was determined to create a haven for people imprisoned for debt.  The colony was also to serve as a buffer between the Spanish to the south and the valuable Carolinas to the north."
1, 23," John Smith","  Smith saved Virginia from collapse by his leadership and resourcefulness.  Taking over in 1608, he told the colonists to produce food instead of mine for gold and whipped the gold-hungry colonists into shape with this rule: ““He who will not work shall not eat.”“"
1, 24," Spanish, French, Dutch, and English Settlement Patterns","  Spanish efforts to extract wealth from the land led them to develop institutions based on subjugating native populations (the encomienda), converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them, along with enslaved and free Africans, into the Spanish colonial society. French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquire furs and other products for export to Europe. English colonization efforts attracted a comparatively large number of male and female British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions.  These colonists focused on agriculture and settled on land taken from Native Americans, from whom they lived separately. Key ID’s Ch. 2, 1619 — 1700 "
2, 1," Protestant Reformation","  A movement of religious reform ignited in 1517 when Martin Luther nailed his protests against Catholic doctrines to the door of Wittenberg’s cathedral. Luther declared that the Bible alone was the source of God’s word; he also denounced the authority of priests and popes.  The Reformation led to religious conflict, missionary zeal, and the development of Puritanism."
2, 2," John Calvin","  Calvin was a Protestant theologian from Geneva who argued that humans were weak and wicked due to original sin. Some souls were predestined to go to heaven and others to hell. This was the foundation of Puritanism."
2, 3," Protestant Ethic","  A Puritan doctrine that stated the Puritans were called to do God’s work on this Earth. It involved serious commitment to work and to engagement in the world’s affairs. "
2, 4," Pilgrims","  These were Separatists, an extreme group of Puritans who sought complete separation from the Church of England. The Pilgrims negotiated with the Virginia Company and secured rights to settle under its jurisdiction but missed their destination. Before landing in 1620 they established the Mayflower Compact."
2, 5," Mayflower Compact, 1620","  The 1620 covenant was the first attempt at self-government in America. It was signed on the Mayflower for the government of Plymouth colony. This set a precedent for other constitutions to follow; it was an agreement to form a governing body and submit to the will of the majority."
2, 6," Puritans","  More moderate than the Pilgrims, Puritans wanted only to separate from impurities of the Anglican Church. They formed Massachusetts Bay Company; beginning in 1630 they began colonizing Massachusetts and other places such as Barbados in the West Indies."
2, 7," Roger Williams","  An extreme Separatist, he criticized the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, denying the authority of government to regulate religion and condemning the expropriation of land from the Indians without fair compensation. He was banished.  In 1636, Williams and his followers founded the colony of Rhode Island and adopted policies of separation of church and state as well as religious toleration.  "
2, 8," Anne Hutchinson","  Hutchinson took the Puritan belief of predestination to logical extremes. She claimed that holy life wasn’t a sure sign of salvation and the truly saved need not to obey either God’s or man’s laws (antinomianism). She was banished from the Bay Colony in 1638 for her beliefs and moved with her family to Rhode Island. She later died in an Indian attack in 1643.  "
2, 9," William Bradford","  Bradford sailed to America on board the Mayflower in 1620. In 1621 he was elected governor of Plymouth Colony and was re-elected thirty times.  He worried that the non-Puritan settlements nearby would corrupt their ““godly experiment in the wilderness.”“  "
2, 10," John Winthrop","  A successful, well-to-do attorney and manor lord in England, he immigrated to Massachusetts to become its governor, believing he had a calling from God to do so. Declaring ““We shall be as a city upon a hill,”“ he helped the colony focus on its common goal, its covenant with God. "
2, 11," Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, 1639","  This was the first written constitution in North America. It established a somewhat democratic system where voters elected a governor and legislature. Unlike most other colonies, the Fundamental Orders did not limit voting to church members."
2, 12," The Colonies of New Haven, Maine, and New Hampshire","  New Haven—1638. Dismayed by what they saw as theological laxity in Massachusetts, the founders of New Haven intended this colony to be governed more strictly by biblical law. It became part of Connecticut in 1665. Maine—In 1623 Ferdinando Gorges of England set up a colony in Maine. Settlers were few, and in 1677 Massachusetts purchased the land from Gorges’s heirs. New Hampshire—Individuals who left Massachusetts for political or religious reasons settled New Hampshire. In 1641, the sparsely-settled area of New Hampshire was absorbed by Massachusetts, but it became a separate royal colony in 1679."
2, 13," New England Confederation, 1643","  This was an alliance among the Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven colonies. Its intended purpose was to provide a common defense against the French, Dutch, and Indians.  Although the Confederation turned out to be rather ineffective due to bickering among its members, it was able to deal with border disputes, runaway servants, and King Philip’s War. The greatest significance of the Confederation is that it was the first alliance among American colonies, and it showed the possibility of the colonies working together in their common interest."
2, 14," King Philip’s War, 1675–1676","  In 1675–1676, the Indian leader Metacom, known to the colonists as King Philip, struck back at whites for their intrusions on Indian lands in New England. Hundreds of settlers (perhaps over 5% of the white population) were killed and dozens of towns were damaged or destroyed, but the whites finally emerged victorious.  King Philip’s War slowed westward expansion by the English for several decades, but it also was a devastating defeat for the Native Americans who posed a lesser threat to the whites in future years."
2, 15," The Restoration—1660 ","  The British monarchy was temporarily replaced by a republic after the execution of King Charles I in 1649. In 1660 the monarchy was restored under Charles’s son Charles II . One effect of this was Charles II’s determination to reassert royal control over the American colonies, temporarily ending salutary neglect."
2, 16," Dominion of New England, 1686–1689","  King James II attempted to increase royal control of the northern colonies to allow stricter enforcement of the Navigation Acts and to strengthen colonial defenses against the French and Indians. Under Governor Edmond Andros, the British limited town meetings, imposed taxes not approved by colonial assemblies, and stringently enforced the Navigation Acts (which led to increased colonial smuggling). When the Glorious Revolution deposed James II, the Dominion collapsed and Andros fled."
2, 17," New Netherland and New Sweden","  New Netherland—1621. This colony, which focused initially on fur trading, occupied much of what are now Manhattan and the Hudson River Valley. In an attempt to draw more settlers, anyone who would bring fifty settlers was offered a patroonship, a large tract of land that he would then control in an almost-feudal manner, controlling taxes, courts, and government. In 1664 this Dutch colony was seized by Britain. New Sweden—1638. This settlement on the Delaware River was intended as a base for trading furs and tobacco. It lasted until 1655 when it was easily conquered by the Dutch."
2, 18," William Penn and the Quakers","  Quakers—More formally known as the Society of Friends, the Quakers suffered persecution in England because of their unorthodox views, their refusal to swear oaths of allegiance to the crown, and their practice of holding services outside of the established Anglican Church. Given a huge amount of land by crown to repay a debt owed to his father; Penn, a Quaker, created Pennsylvania in 1681. Penn offered colonists religious freedom (although he was forced by the crown not to allow Catholics or Jews to vote or hold political office), no tax-supported state church, no military, excellent relations with the Indians, and no restrictions on immigration."
2, 19," The Middle Colonies—New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware","  New York (1664, seized from the Dutch), New Jersey (1664, also formerly controlled by the Dutch), Pennsylvania (1681, see above), and Delaware (1682, also granted to William Penn) made up the middle colonies. These colonies were known for their rich, fertile soil, which led to their rich exports of grain; their deep harbors, which encouraged shipping and trade; and their broad rivers, which facilitated transportation but which were too slow to generate power for industry (as the cascading rivers of New England did)."
2, 20," Mercantilism and the Navigation Acts","  Mercantilism was the dominant economic theory of the time. It argued that a) a nation’s strength was based on the amount of gold and silver it possessed because with gold and silver, a nation could obtain ships, weapons, troops, supplies, etc., b) a nation obtained more gold and silver by exporting more than it imported, and c) colonies were to help the mother country become wealthier by sending the mother country inexpensive raw materials and buying from the mother country expensive manufactured products. One manifestation of the mercantilist system, the Navigation Acts required that goods could only be transported on British or colonial ships; tobacco, furs, sugar, and indigo were to be exported to England only; and imports could only be purchased from England.  Examples included the Wool Act of 1699 (forbidding the American colonies from exporting wool since that would compete with British wool producers), the Molasses Act of 1733 (taxing the importation of molasses from non-British sources), and the Iron Act of 1750 (limiting the colonial manufacture of metal goods such as knives and nails). Colonists rebelled and smuggling became common."
2, 21," Glorious Revolution, 1688–1689","  The Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689 dethroned the unpopular Catholic James II. He was replaced with the Protestant rulers of the Netherlands, Dutch-born William III and his English wife Mary, daughter of James II.  When the news reached America, the Dominion of New England collapsed. The new rulers enforced the Navigation Acts less strictly, leading to a period of salutary neglect. "
2, 22," Salutary Neglect","  This was the non-enforcement of mercantilist policies due to Britain focusing its attention more on the struggles with France than on ruling the colonies. Although British enforcement waxed and waned, in general salutary neglect lasted until the end of the French and Indian War in 1763.  Key ID’s Ch. 3, 1607-1692 "
3, 1,"	The Unhealthful Chesapeake","  Most early settlers in the Virginia and Maryland colonies on Chesapeake Bay were men seeking their fortune from tobacco. They outnumbered women six to one in 1650, so marriages were few. In addition, settlers in these colonies died, on average, ten years sooner than did residents of England primarily as the result of malaria, typhoid, and other diseases. As a result, families were fragile as mates often died within a few years, social restrictions were weaker (many women were already pregnant at the time of marriage), and society was more individualistic."
3, 2," Headright System","  A system in Virginia and Maryland that encouraged the importation of servant workers, it gave 50 acres of land to anyone who paid for passage of a person to the colony. This was often used by wealthier landowners who paid for the importation of indentured servants."
3, 3," Indentured Servants","  These people promised to work for several years in the colonies in exchange for transatlantic passage and eventual freedom dues—some seed corn, clothes, and, at least in earlier years, a little land. Indentured servants accounted for three-quarters of all European immigrants to Virginia and Maryland in the seventeenth century."
3, 4," Bacon’s Rebellion, 1676","  In 1676 led by Nathaniel Bacon, a number of former indentured servants who had come into conflict with the Indians over land on the western frontier of Virginia rebelled against the rule of Governor Berkeley. Berkeley supported the Indians due to his monopoly of the fur trade with them. Bacon’s forces responded by burning Jamestown. After Bacon’s death by disease, Berkeley crushed the rebellion by hanging many participants. Following Bacon’s Rebellion, many planters began to look for a more easily controlled labor force than indentured servants. Black slavery increased as a result."
3, 5," The Introduction of Slavery, 1619","  Dutch traders brought twenty African slaves to Jamestown in 1619 (ironically, the same year that representative government came to North America with the establishment of Virginia’s House of Burgesses).  From this beginning slavery spread to all thirteen American colonies. Eventually approximately 650,000 slaves were imported to the US through the international slave trade. After 1698, the British monopoly on the American slave trade ended, and American shippers joined the slave trade."
3, 6," Middle Passage","  This was the slaves’ journey from Africa to the Americas. Herded upon ships and chained below deck, they suffered death rates as high as 20% on the journey. "
3, 7," New York City Slave Rebellion, 1712","  Twenty-three slaves armed with guns, hatchets, and swords set fire to a building. When white colonists gathered to extinguish the blaze, the slaves attacked. Nine whites were killed. Militia units captured twenty-seven slaves. Of these, six committed suicide. The rest were executed. In response, New York slave laws were tightened. Gatherings of more than three slaves were banned, masters could punish a slave however they wished as long as the slave was not killed or maimed, and any slave handling a firearm would be whipped. Nevertheless, another similar arson-based rebellion occurred in New York City a few years later in 1741."
3, 8," Stono Rebellion, 1739","  A group of about fifty slaves on the Stono River of South Carolina rebelled, seized weapons, and killed about twenty-five whites. They headed for Spanish Florida where they hoped to find refuge but were intercepted by the white militia. The slaves were killed in the battle or later executed. This led to the passage of a harsher slave code that limited the privileges of slaves in order to eliminate the possibility of a slave revolt in the future. Slaves would no longer be allowed to grow their own food, assemble in groups, earn their own money, or learn to read. This was only one among the 250 slave rebellions documented in the South."
3, 9," Maroon Communities","  From the beginnings of slavery in the New World, slaves ran away. When they banded together in communities, they were known as maroons (from the Spanish for fugitive). In what became the United States, there were maroon communities in the Florida swamps (hence the desire of the Stono rebels to reach Spanish Florida), in the bayous of Louisiana, and in the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina. In some cases, the maroon communities carried on guerrilla war against the white-held plantations, even siding with the British at times during the Revolutionary War. The significance of the maroon communities was that they demonstrated the yearning for freedom by the enslaved."
3, 10," Healthful New England","  Better water and cooler temperatures meant that fewer colonists died of disease in New England. In fact, New England colonists lived, on average, ten years longer than did residents of England and twenty years longer than did colonists in the Chesapeake region. Longer life spans combined with the fact that Puritans tended to arrive in entire families rather than single individuals led to stronger, more stable families than in the Chesapeake region. For example, fewer brides were pregnant at the time of marriage. In addition, society was less individualistic and more focused on the community."
3, 11," The Halfway Covenant","  Relatively few second-generation Puritans were willing to join the church. Doing so meant subjecting oneself to extensive interrogation about one’s morals. Some of these interrogations lasted over a year. Because the Puritan church baptized only the babies born to saints, many first-generation Puritans faced the prospect that their grandchildren would not be baptized. So the church developed the Halfway Covenant that baptized the children of all baptized adults, whether or not the adults were church members. The adults were halfway members of the church who could not take communion or vote in church affairs. Most adults opted for this halfway status. This was the end of the Puritan mission to create the shining city on a hill since the first-generation was not able to produce a second generation with equal religious fervor.  "
3, 12," Jeremiads","  Sermons preached from Puritan pulpits in the middle of the seventeenth century, named for Jeremiah, a Biblical prophet who warned of doom. Puritan preachers noticed a decline in the religious devotion of second-generation settlers; to combat this decreasing piety, they preached a type of sermon called the jeremiad, scolding parishioners on their waning piety."
3, 13," The Salem Witch Trials, 1692","  Accusations by young girls in Salem, Massachusetts, led to the arrest of hundreds and the execution of nineteen for witchcraft. The witchcraft hysteria revealed the conflicts within Salem and the divergence of Salem and other Puritan communities from their original religious mission."
3, 14," Leisler’s Rebellion, 1689-1691","  In New York Jacob Leisler was a prosperous merchant, but he had never been accepted by the colonial elite. Following the Glorious Revolution that overthrew King James, the Dominion of New England collapsed. Leisler drove out Sir Edmond Andros’s lieutenant governor and proclaimed himself the head of the government in New York. Eventually he was executed for his reluctance in turning over power to William and Mary’s new governor. Though Leisler’s Rebellion was unsuccessful, it represented the tensions between the middle class (to which Leisler belonged) and the colonial elite. Key ID’s Ch. 4, 1700-1775"
4, 1," Colonial Population Boom","  Between 1700 and 1775, population in the thirteen colonies increased over 800%, from about 300,000 to 2,500,000. In part, this was due to immigration and in part to the practice of having large families. The significance of this is that it led to a shift in the balance of political and military power away from Britain and toward America. In 1700 there were twenty Britons for every American; by 1775 the ratio was only three to one."
4, 2," The Enlightenment","  Also known as the Age of Reason, this was a period in which reason and observation of nature began to replace revelation, reliance on tradition or traditional authority, and inward illumination as the dominant means of acquiring knowledge and understanding the world. In the American colonies, this had a number of effects. The works of European Enlightenment thinkers, especially John Locke, encouraged colonists to consider resistance to British control. European Enlightenment ideas inspired many American political thinkers to emphasize individual talent over hereditary privilege, thus promoting more social mobility in America. In religion, the ideas of the Enlightenment promoted deism, a variety of Christianity that holds that God exists, that He created the universe, but does not intervene in the affairs of humankind. It was an effort to reconcile the existence of God with newly surfacing scientific discoveries and belief in the existence of free will.  Enlightenment ideas were also one source of republican motherhood, which called on women to teach republican values within the family and granted women a new importance in American society."
4, 3," Anglicization","  This referred to the process of the American colonies gradually adopting more British values and customs over time. Colonial governments were based on English models (with a governor instead of a king, an upper house or council instead of the House of Lords, and a lower house or assembly instead of the House of Commons). Frequent contact with Britain via the trans-Atlantic print culture spread British ideas through newspapers and books that were sent from England to the colonies. Protestant Evangelicalism – George Whitefield, John Wesley, and others from England traveled across to colonies to spread religious ideas."
4, 4," The Paxton Boys—1763","  Scots-Irish immigrants were noted for their violent conflicts with Native Americans over control of land. In Paxton, Pennsylvania, the Scots-Irish community felt its requests for aid against the Indians were being ignored by colonial legislators, many of whom were Quakers and pacifists. When a group from Paxton responded to Indian conflicts by killing a tribe of peaceful Indians, the governor issued warrants for their arrest and offered protection to a group of Christianized Indians. Angered that the government would side with Native Americans, the Paxton Boys marched on the capital. Benjamin Franklin and others were able to arrange a peaceful meeting between officials and the Paxton boys, allowing the frontiersmen to air their grievances. This event was significant in that it was one of a series of conflicts between the colonial elite to the east and the poorer settlers on the western frontier. "
4, 5," Structure of Colonial Society","  In contrast to society in England, colonial society was more flexible. It was possible for a poor person to achieve economic success and rise to a higher rank. Yet as the Paxton Boys illustrated, there were real class tensions in the colonies. The largest colonial group consisted of yeoman farmers, those individuals who owned their own land, but who owned no slaves and could not afford to hire farm hands. Jefferson argued that this group of independent farmers formed the basis for democracy."
4, 6," Attempts to Ban the Slave Trade","  Slaves made up a significant portion of colonial society, about 20% overall in 1750. Concerns over slave rebellions and the injustice of slavery led some colonies to attempt to ban the international slave trade. The British authorities blocked these efforts. Under a mercantilist system, the sale of slaves (or other goods) to a colony simply enriched and strengthened the mother country. These British obstacles to ending the slave trade led Thomas Jefferson to include in his original draft of the Declaration of Independence a paragraph condemning King George III for this, but objections from South Carolina and Georgia resulted in this passage being deleted from the final draft."
4, 7," Triangle Trade","  This was a profitable trade circuit in which a skipper would leave a New England port with a cargo of rum, travel to Africa, and trade the rum for slaves. Then he would sail to the West Indies and trade the slaves for sugar and molasses, which he took back to New England to be distilled into rum to start the cycle over again."
4, 8," Established Churches","  Established churches, that is, official state churches supported by tax dollars, were common in the colonies. In New England, the Puritan church was the established church. In the southern colonies and the New York City area, the Anglican Church (Church of England) was the established church. The King of England was the head of the Anglican Church and, as such, could exercise both religious and political power. But the bonds between the Anglicans in America and the King were weak. The Anglican Church had no bishop in the colonies, so prospective ministers had to travel to England to be ordained. American ministers were to report to and be guided by their superiors in England, but distance made that difficult. Further, American Anglican clergymen often found that the wealthy planters who paid their salaries expected the ministers to be controlled by the planters, not the Church in Britain. The Anglican Church talked of establishing an American bishop in the period prior to the Revolution, but this was resisted by the colonists as an extension of kingly authority. Other factors weakening the hold of the Church of England included the fact that there was no college for training Anglican ministers until the establishment of the College of William and Mary in 1693. (Harvard, established 1636, trained Puritan ministers.) Anglican clergy in England preferred to find a congregation in England rather than serving in the rustic parishes of Virginia or Maryland. By 1672 more than 90% of Virginia parishes lacked ordained clergymen. Finally, the services were, to English critics, shockingly informal: parts of the service were often omitted, many of the clergy did not wear formal ecclesiastical garments, and in many churches there was no altar with candle and cross. With the American Revolution came a strong push for disestablishment of churches. The last state to strip tax support from the official church was Massachusetts in 1833."
4, 9," Jonathan Edwards","   Congregationalist minister Jonathan Edwards set off a religious revival known as the First Great Awakening in 1734. Edwards proclaimed the folly of believing in salvation through good works and affirmed the need for complete dependence on God’s grace. He was famous for his ““Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God”“ sermon."
4, 10," George Whitefield","  Whitefield was a powerful preacher and the other leading figure in the First Great Awakening. He relied on emotional appeals and effective oratory to convert sinners. Listeners often cried out, rolled on the ground, and fainted as Whitefield described the terrors of hell."
4, 11," The First Great Awakening—1730’s &amp; 1740’s","  At a time when the vitality was oozing away from many religious denominations, the Great Awakening, sparked by Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, brought a new passion and emotion to religion. The first mass movement of the American people, the Great Awakening broke down sectional boundaries and denominational lines, creating greater religious diversity. But it contributed to the growing sense that Americans had of themselves as a single people. In addition, it called on people to decide things on their individual consciences rather than on the authority of the powerful. In this sense, it was a step toward the American Revolution."
4, 12," Old and New Lights","  Old Lights were orthodox clergymen who were deeply skeptical of the emotionalism and the theatrical antics of the Great Awakening revivalists. New Lights were ministers who defended the Great Awakening for its role in revitalizing American religion."
4, 13," John Peter Zenger","  Zenger was a newspaper publisher who criticized the corrupt governor of New York and was charged with seditious libel. Andrew (not Alexander) Hamilton defended Zenger, arguing that since his charges were true, he should not be punished. The jury acquitted Zenger, helping to establish the doctrine of freedom of the press."
4, 14," Colonial Government","  Colonial governments generally consisted of governor (appointed by the king or the proprietor and expected to protect the interests of the king or proprietor), a council made up of the colonial elite (appointed and generally supportive of the governor), and a lower house or assembly (elected and generally protective of the interests of the merchants and farmers who elected them). Colonial governors often found themselves caught between what they knew to be the king’s wishes (which they were bound to carry out) and the laws passed by the assembly. These laws could contradict royal policy, but the governors often approved them anyway since failure to do so would lead the assembly to cut off the governor’s salary. The right to vote was not universal. It was restricted to free, white, adult males who, depending on the colony, belonged to the established church and/or owned land and paid sufficient taxes on that land. Yet it was relatively easy to obtain land in America, so perhaps half the adult white males were eligible to vote. However, women, Indians, slaves, and others were disenfranchised, so only 10% to 20% of the total population could vote. The vast physical separation from England (leading to long lags in communication back and forth), the dispersed population in the colonies, and the belief shared by many colonists that local self-government protected liberty while distant, concentrated authority tended toward tyranny all led many colonists to desire more self-government and to resist English authority. "
4, 15," Regulator Movement—1768-1771","  Frontiersmen in North Carolina felt the colonial elite was not representing their interests. They formed armed bands to halt foreclosures, etc., but were eventually defeated by the state militia. During the Revolution, many of the former Regulators became Loyalists, not because they loved England, but because they saw the colonial elite as their main enemy."
4, 16," Molasses Act—1733","  To discourage trade with French West Indies, Parliament levied duties on molasses, sugar, and rum imported to the colonies from non-British sources. New England, especially, protested. When Parliament did not budge, the colonists proceeded to ignore the law and engage in wholesale smuggling."
4, 17," Treaty of Utrecht—1713","  This treaty ended Queen Anne’s War (1702-1713); France gave Britain Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the Hudson Bay region. This treaty ushered in a generation of peace during which Britain engaged in the policy of salutary neglect, allowing the colonies to develop a degree of independence. Key ID’s Ch. 5, 1608-1763"
5, 1," French Colonial Policy","  Unlike the English who allowed free emigration to the New World as a way to deal with surplus population, the French were more restrictive. To ensure the loyalty of French colonists, they limited emigration to Catholics (France was a predominantly Catholic country). In addition, whereas English peasants often did not own the land they farmed and often lost the opportunity to farm as a result of the Enclosure movement (landowners displaced renters for the more profitable business of raising sheep to produce wool for England’s growing textile industry), French peasants generally owned their own land and lacked this incentive to emigrate. So, unlike the English colonies where large numbers of farmers worked the land intensely, French colonists focused on fur trading and grasped their lands more loosely. From a financial perspective, the French government found the sugar islands of the Caribbean to be much more valuable than the vast lands of New France (Canada) and so focused its attention on the islands. As a result, the population of the French colonies of North America was less than that of the English colonies."
5, 2," Huguenots","  A group of French Protestants, they were persecuted in their homeland. They were barred entrance to New France (Canada); this was one reason the French colony there grew slowly. Instead, many of those who were allowed to leave France settled in what eventually became New York (then New Netherland)."
5, 3," Acadians","  Acadians were the original French settlers of the seaboard area that is now Nova Scotia. This area was ceded to Britain from France in 1713. The Acadians were supposed to swear allegiance to Britain, but they didn’t. All was well until 1755 when the British drove the Acadians out of their home by force. They fled to Louisiana, a French colony at the time, where they are now known as Cajuns."
5, 4," The Beaver Wars—1640-1701","  This was a series of wars in which the powerful Iroquois tribes from upper New York, having hunted out the beaver in their territory, expanded their control into the Old Northwest defeating the Hurons and Algonquins (allies of the French). The major cause was the desire of the Iroquois Confederacy to expand their territory and to monopolize control of the fur trade with Europeans. These wars were among the bloodiest in North America. Their results included the disruption of Huron and Algonquin culture and the replacement of the French by the English as the dominant European power in the fur trade. The French and English used their Indian allies to raid each other’s settlements, and the English based their claims to the Ohio Valley in part on their agreements with the Iroquois."
5, 5," Praying Towns—1650-1675","  These were communities of Christianized Indians in Massachusetts. Puritans hoped that these communities would lead the Indians to give up native ways, including their hunter- gatherer economy. In return, the Indians received education and material support. However, when King Philip’s War came in 1675, the praying Indians were not trusted by the  whites even though many fought with the English, and many were removed from their lands."
5, 6," Albany Congress—1754","  The immediate goal was to keep the Iroquois tribes loyal to the British in the French and Indian War. The long-range purpose was to achieve greater colonial unity and thus bolster the common defense against France. Benjamin Franklin proposed a scheme for colonial home rule; however, that was turned down by the individual colonies who felt the plan did not offer enough independence to each colony and by the British who felt that it offered too much."
5, 7," Fort Duquesne and Fort Necessity—1754","  To link their holdings in Canada and the lower Mississippi River Valley, the French erected a series of forts in the Ohio Valley. Fort Duquesne was particularly strategic, located at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. Twenty-one-year-old George Washington was sent by Virginia into the Ohio Valley to protect Virginia’s claims to the region. Approaching Fort Duquesne, he encountered a French force, hastily built Fort Necessity, and was defeated. This battle touched off the French and Indian (or Seven Years’) War."
5, 8," General Edward Braddock’s Defeat in the Ohio Valley—1755","  The British sent General Edward Braddock and a strong British force, along with Virginia militiamen, to capture Fort Duquesne. He was ambushed by a smaller French and Indian force; Braddock was killed and his forces soundly defeated. Braddock’s defeat opened Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey to Indian raids."
5, 9," William Pitt","  A great and popular British leader, Pitt came to power in 1757. He earned the title ““Organizer of Victory”“ because of his smart military decisions. His leadership helped win the French and Indian War. Pitt opposed the King’s stubborn policies against the colonies but never favored complete independence."
5, 10," Battle of Quebec—1759","  One of the significant battles in British and American history, it helped to end the French and Indian War. British General Wolfe, appointed by Pitt, defeated the French General Montcalm by sending his troops up a cliff under cover of darkness."
5, 11," Treaty of Paris—1763","  This treaty ended the French and Indian War and removed France from the North American mainland. France ceded its Canadian holdings to England. To compensate its Spanish ally, France ceded its territory west of the Mississippi (Louisiana) to Spain. For the American colonists, the treaty ended the threat posed by the French. It also strengthened them because Native Americans could no longer play the French and British against each other in an attempt to limit the encroachment of colonists on Indian lands."
5, 12," The Impact of the French and Indian War","  The war provided military experience to a number of colonists, most notably Washington. It led many colonists to assume that they were on the same level as the professional soldiers of the British army who were no longer seen as invincible. The war provided an increased sense of colonial unity needed to meet common challenges. As noted above, the successful conclusion of the war eliminated the French threat, allowing the colonists to feel less need for a British presence in America.  The British were disdainful of the military abilities of the colonists and had treated the colonial soldiers with contempt, increasing tensions between the two groups. The British ended the war with a huge debt incurred, they felt, in defending the colonists. Accordingly, the British sought funds to pay off this debt from reluctant colonies. While the British had been busy fighting the French, they had not paid close attention to the enforcement of the Navigation Acts. Now, with the French vanquished, the period of salutary neglect was over, and the British tried to enforce these laws on a defiant America."
5, 13," Pontiac’s Rebellion—1763","  With their French allies gone, Pontiac led Indians in an attempt to push the British out of the Ohio Valley. His forces killed 2,000 soldiers and settlers and captured eight British forts. The British responded with military force and smallpox-infected blankets, crushing the rebellion. This uprising convinced the British of the necessity of stabilizing relations with Native Americans and of maintaining a large military presence in the colonies, a force the colonists would have to pay for."
5, 14," Proclamation of 1763","  This stated that Indian land west of the Appalachian Mountains was not open for settlement. It recognized Indian land titles until such time as tribal governments ceded that land through treaties. The purpose was to prevent another Indian uprising. The Proclamation angered colonists who felt that their sacrifices in the recent war entitled them to this land.  Key ID’s Ch. 6, 1763-1775 "
6, 1," Lord Grenville—End of Salutary Neglect","  Grenville was British Prime Minister from 1763-1765.  In order to compensate Britain for the debt incurred defending North America during the French and Indian War and to pay part of the cost of maintaining forces in the colonies, he sought to tax the colonies to provide revenue. In 1763 he ordered the Navy to enforce the unpopular Navigation Laws and was responsible for the Sugar Act, Quartering Act, and Stamp Act."
6, 2," Sugar Act—1764","  This law was intended to raise revenue and reduce smuggling. It raised duties on refined sugar, textiles, and other goods imported from places other than Britain or British colonies. But it reduced the duties on molasses imported from the French West Indies in an effort to reduce smuggling. The British clearly intended to enforce this law. Stronger enforcement, they hoped, would lead to higher revenues. The law also discarded many traditional English protections for fair trials, giving judges a financial incentive to find violators guilty and presuming guilt, not innocence, on the part of the accused."
6, 3," Writs of Assistance","  The writs of assistance were general search warrants, court orders authorizing British officials to search colonial homes, ships, and buildings for smuggled goods. Writs of assistance permitted a colonial official to search any place and seize any smuggled goods."
6, 4," Admiralty Courts","  In an admiralty court, no jury (often sympathetic to the accused colonist) was allowed. Instead a judge (appointed by Britain) decided the case. The burden of proof was on the defendant, who was assumed guilty until proven innocent.  Colonists felt their rights as Englishmen were being violated by trial in admiralty courts."
6, 5," Traditional Rights of Englishmen","  By the 17th century, a combination of English common law and statute law helped protect an individual against governmental tyranny and give that individual certain basic rights: life, liberty, or property could not be taken away arbitrarily, if he was arrested he was entitled to a statement of charges and a speedy trial by jury, and government officials couldn’t search his home without a warrant."
6, 6," Quartering Act—1765","  This act required colonists to provide food and shelter to British soldiers, who many colonists believed were only present to keep the colonists in line."
6, 7," Stamp Act—1765","  This required that revenue stamps be affixed to legal papers, licenses, newspapers, pamphlets, playing cards, and many other items.  Stamp taxes were common in Britain. Grenville thought it reasonable to ask colonists to pay for part of their own defense. Colonists protested strongly. This was the first internal tax levied by Parliament. It hit all segments of society, but it particularly affected lawyers and newspaper publishers—two of the most articulate and influential groups in the colonies."
6, 8," Stamp Act Congress—1765–1766","  This group met in New York City with twenty-seven delegates from nine colonies. The delegates affirmed that Parliament had no authority to levy taxes outside Britain and urged colonists to adopt non-importation agreements. This was a step toward colonial unity. "
6, 9," Non-importation Agreements","  The non-importation agreements were promises to boycott British goods. Domestic products, such as homespun fabric replaced British imports. The Sons and Daughters of Liberty took this quite seriously, enforcing the agreements with tar and feathers and hanging stamp agents in effigy. The tax collecting operation broke down, and stamp taxes were never collected. The British economy was hurt by the boycott and thousands of Englishmen were thrown out of work, leading to British demands for the repeal of the Stamp Act. "
6, 10," Sons of Liberty","  Taking the law into their own hands, they enforced the non-importation agreements against violators, often by tarring and feathering them. Houses of unpopular officials were ransacked; stamp agents were hanged in effigy on liberty poles."
6, 11," Declaratory Act—1766","  This act was passed after the repeal of the Stamp Act. This measure proclaimed that Parliament had the right to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.  This was a feeble victory for Britain, however, since the colonists had already proven that the Parliament could be forced to yield to boycotts and mob action."
6, 12," Townshend Acts—1767","  Charles Townshend, Chancellor of the Exchequer, proposed that Britain accept the colonial distinction between internal and external taxes. He convinced Parliament to levy taxes on imports of lead, paper, paint, and tea and to send special revenue officers to collect the duties. The revenues raised by this act would be used to pay the salaries of royal governors and judges in America. Colonists regarded the acts as another attempt to control them. Nonimportation agreements were implemented again. Sam Adams persuaded Massachusetts to send a Circular Letter to other colonies urging united opposition to British policies."
6, 13," Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania—1767-1768","  John Dickinson responded to the Townshend Acts with a series of letters, widely read, that equated taxation without representation with slavery. Dickinson acknowledged that Parliament could regulate trade, but he argued that only the colonists could tax themselves for the purpose of raising revenue.  Dickinson was also persuasive in calling for united resistance by the colonies."
6, 14," The Boston Massacre—1770","  British officials placed two regiments of troops in Boston in 1768 to combat the violence stirred up by customs officers. The colonials resented the presence of the troops and taunted them unmercifully. On the evening of March 5, 1770, a crowd of 60 townspeople set upon a squad of ten soldiers, hit one with a club, and knocked down another. Acting without orders but under extreme provocation, the troops opened fire and killed or wounded eleven citizens. Only two of the soldiers were convicted. This further inflamed the colonials against the British."
6, 15," The Gaspee Incident—1772","  Merchants and ship owners continued to smuggle goods into the colonies to avoid import duties. When the Gaspee, an English customs ship, ran aground off Rhode Island, colonists boarded the ship and set it afire to show their displeasure. The accused were sent to Britain for trial. Colonial outrage stimulated the development of the Committees of Correspondence. "
6, 16," Committees of Correspondence","  In response to the Gaspee Incident, Sam Adams organized a committee in Boston to communicate with patriots in other towns and colonies. The concept spread rapidly; by the following year, there were eighty committees in Massachusetts alone. The committees printed political pamphlets, organized resistance to the Crown, supported non-importation agreements, and, in Boston, helped organize the Boston Tea Party. The committees were important in helping to unify the colonies. "
6, 17," Samuel Adams","  Samuel Adams organized the local committees of correspondence in Massachusetts. A master propagandist and engineer of rebellion, he became known as the ““penman of the Revolution.”“ "
6, 18," East India Tea Co.","  The East India Tea Company was about to go bankrupt and had 17 million pounds of unsold tea. The London government would lose a great deal in tax revenue if the company went bankrupt, so they granted the company a monopoly on the American market."
6, 19," Tea Act—1773","  The Tea Act reduced the tax on tea to aid the East India Tea Company. But this meant that colonial smugglers could no longer undercut the legal price, hurting their business. Also colonial merchants were upset by the precedent of granting British companies monopolies in colonial markets."
6, 20," Boston Tea Party—Dec. 1773","  In protest against the Tea Act, a group of Bostonians boarded ships in Boston Harbor and dumped 342 crates of tea overboard. This led to Britain’s response—the Intolerable or Coercive Acts."
6, 21," Intolerable/Coercive Acts—1774","  These acts included the Boston Port Act, which shut down Boston Harbor until the tea was paid for; the Massachusetts Government Act, which revoked the Massachusetts charter and made the government less democratic; an expanded Quartering Act; and the Administration of Justice Act, which removed the power of colonial courts to try royal officers."
6, 22," Quebec Act—1774 ","  Though a separate act, this was generally grouped by colonists with the Intolerable Acts. The Quebec Act alarmed the colonies because it recognized the Catholic Church in Quebec. Some colonials took it as a sign that Britain was planning to impose Catholicism upon the colonies."
6, 23," The First Continental Congress—September 1774","  In response to the Intolerable Acts, delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies met to consider ways of redressing colonial grievances. John Adams swayed his colleagues toward a revolutionary course, defeating the proposal for American home rule under British direction.  They drew up the Declaration of Rights and Grievances (argued against taxation without representation and against virtual representation) and appeals to British people (asking not for independence but for a change in British policy). They also created the Association.  "
6, 24," The Association ","  Created by the First Continental Congress, it enforced the non-importation and non-consumption of British goods and non-exportation of American goods to Britain by empowering local Committees of Vigilance in each colony. Violators were to be punished by publicity or boycott. This was meant to pressure Britain to repeal the Coercive Acts. Though the Association managed to cut British imports by 97% in 1775, the British, determined not to repeal the Coercive Acts, did not give in."
6, 25," Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts—April 1775","  General Gage, stationed in Boston, was ordered to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock. The British marched on Lexington, where they believed Adams and Hancock were hiding. The colonial militias attempted to block the progress of the troops and were fired on by the British at Lexington. The British continued to Concord, where they believed the colonials had a cache of weapon; they were attacked by the colonial militia. As the British retreated to Boston, the colonials continued to shoot at them from behind cover on the sides of the road. This was the first battle of the Revolutionary War. Key ID’s Ch. 7, 1775-1783 "
7, 1," Fort Ticonderoga—May 1775","  A small force of American soldiers under the leadership of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold surprised and captured the British garrisons at Ticonderoga and Crown Point in May of 1775. A valuable supply of powder and artillery was secured for the siege of Boston. "
7, 2," Battle of Breed’s Hill—June 1775 ","  British forces launched a frontal attack against American forces on Breed’s (not Bunker) Hill and suffered over 1100 casualties to 300 for the colonials. The British won when a lack of gunpowder forced colonists to retreat. In response, many Britons demanded retaliation. The King declared New England in a state of rebellion. In December Parliament extended this to all colonies."
7, 3," Second Continental Congress","  The First Continental Congress had called for a second congress to meet if King George did not agree to their demands. So in 1775, the Second Continental Congress convened.  Initially many delegates opposed independence and supported John Dickinson’s Olive Branch Petition. Prodded in part by Paine’s Common Sense, the Congress drafted and signed the Declaration of Independence, which justified the Revolutionary War and declared that the colonies should be independent of Britain.  The other accomplishments of this Second Continental Congress were the appointment of George Washington as commander of the Continental Army, the writing of the Articles of Confederation, and the direction of the war against Britain."
7, 4," Olive Branch Petition—July 1775","  On July 8, 1775, the colonies made a final offer of peace to King George, agreeing to be loyal to him if the British government addressed their grievances (repeal the Coercive Acts, end taxation without representation). This appeal, arriving in London at the same time as news of Breed’s Hill, was rejected. "
7, 5," Appointment of Washington ","  There were some misgivings regarding this appointment; Washington had never risen above the rank of colonel in the army and had never commanded more than twelve hundred men. However, he was gifted with outstanding powers of leadership and possessed an immense strength of character. He acted as a symbol and a rallying point for the colonists."
7, 6," Thomas Paine, Common Sense","  Published in 1776, Common Sense was one of the most influential pamphlets ever written. It stated that America should set herself up as an independent, democratic republic. Paine helped to convince thousands of Americans that independence was necessary. Also Paine reminded the Americans that the French would never help them if they still swore allegiance to the British Crown."
7, 7," Declaration of Independence, July 1776","  It was drafted by Thomas Jefferson. The Continental Congress accepted most of Jefferson’s draft but cut several sections including one in which Jefferson denounced the slave trade. It argued that all people have natural rights, a doctrine expounded earlier by the British philosopher John Locke. By this, Jefferson meant that people, by their mere existence, have rights that no government can justly take from them. People have the right to rebel against any government that tries to do so. It blamed King George for the problems leading to the Revolution. It declared, finally, the independence of the United States."
7, 8," Hessians","  King George hired 30,000 German mercenaries, known as Hessians. The British army doubled in size during the Revolutionary War. The British decision to hire foreign mercenaries was an emotional shock to the colonists, further widening the gap between the US and Britain."
7, 9," George Rogers Clark & Victories in the West","  Clark conceived the idea of seizing by surprise the scattered forts the British captured from the French in the wild Illinois country. He floated down the Ohio River with 175 men and successfully captured in quick succession three forts. This helped to persuade the British eventually to give the region north of the Ohio River to the United States. "
7, 10," Lafayette","  The young (nineteen) French general donated $200,000 and his efforts, and helped the US secure further aid from France."
7, 11," Battle of Saratoga—Oct. 1777","  Militarily, this battle was significant in that it halted a British attempt to split New England from the rest of the colonies, and it resulted in the surrender of Gen. Burgoyne’s army to the Americans. Diplomatically, Saratoga was even more important since it convinced the French that the US could win the war and deserved diplomatic recognition. The next year the French declared war on England, as did Spain and Holland in 1779. The British responded to Saratoga by offering the colonies home rule within the British Empire—essentially what most colonists had wanted all along. "
7, 12," Leading Patriot Women","  Mercy Otis Warren—Warren was college educated, very unusual for women at the time. After her brother James Otis was beaten for his Patriot activities, Warren began writing and publishing Patriot propaganda in letters to newspapers, political pamphlets, and satirical plays (the first plays written by an American woman). After the Revolution Warren took an Anti-Federalist stance and opposed ratification of the Constitution since it lacked a bill of rights. Abigail Adams—Adams was the wife and confidant of John Adams. When John was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress that was debating the Declaration of Independence, Abigail urged him to include the principle of legal equality for women, writing, ““I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could.”“"
7, 13," Loyalists (Tories)","  These were Americans who remained loyal to the King.  They comprised a quarter to a third of the population. They were generally people of education and wealth who were satisfied with their lot and who believed violent change would be only for the worse.  Loyalists were often older people, royal officers, Anglican clergymen and Anglican church members."
7, 14," Pennsylvania Gradual Emancipation Law—1780 ","  As Americans fought for independence, some began to take seriously the claim of liberty for all, including slaves. Pennsylvania was the first state to take action. No new slaves could be brought into the state, and children born to slaves were freed when they turned 28. But slavery was ended only gradually. Anyone a slave when the law passed was a slave for life, and Pennsylvania still had 400 slaves in 1830.  Free blacks were aided immediately by the law which ended the ban on interracial marriage and allowed them to testify in court. Free blacks were, however, barred from voting and serving in the militia."
7, 15," Benedict Arnold","  An American general who fought well for the US early in the war, he tried to help the British take West Point, a key to the Hudson River, but he was found out and declared a traitor. "
7, 16," Battle of Yorktown—Oct. 1781","  British General Cornwallis had fallen back to Yorktown to await sea-borne supplies and replacements. However, American General Washington attacked by land while French Admiral De Grasse blocked the British escape by sea. Together they forced General Cornwallis to surrender his entire force of 7000 men.  This did not end the war, but it did force the British to begin serious peace negotiations with the Americans."
7, 17," Treaty of Paris—1783","  This treaty ended the Revolutionary War, recognized the independence of the American colonies, and granted the colonies the territory from the southern border of Canada to the northern border of Florida, and from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi River. It also allowed Americans to retain fishing rights on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, at that time one of the world’s richest fisheries. American negotiators Ben Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay ignored their instructions to negotiate alongside their French allies. Instead, they struck a separate deal with the British, one that was probably more favorable to the US than a French-controlled treaty would have been. Britain was happy to give the US liberal terms, hoping to split the new nation from its French ally."
7, 18," Impact of Revolution on American society, economics, and politics","  Social: Increased social equality, increased separation of church and state, encouraged gradual elimination of slavery in Northern states, elevated the status of women through the ideal of republican motherhood. Economic: An end to primogeniture (limited land inheritance to the first-born son) and entail (prohibited division of an estate upon inheritance), abolition of imprisonment for debt Political: New constitutions for the states, most containing a bill of rights, along with reductions of property qualifications for voting and holding office"
7, 19," Articles of Confederation","  The Articles of Confederation were the framework of the new government adopted in 1781; it created a loose league of thirteen sovereign states. This new government was extremely weak and had difficulty maintaining order, commanding respect from foreign governments, or improving economic conditions. However, the US government under the Articles did manage to successfully prosecute the war and conclude a favorable peace.  Key ID’s Ch. 8, 1776 - 1790 "
8, 1," Weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation","  It was difficult for Congress to enact laws because nine votes out of thirteen were required. Congress had no power to levy taxes but could only request funds from the states. The states ignored three-fourths of these requests. Congress could issue money but couldn’t prevent states from issuing their own. Rhode Island, for example, issued its own inflated and nearly worthless paper currency and then passed laws mandating that creditors accept this paper money for payment of all debts. Six other states also issued large quantities of paper money. Congress couldn’t control interstate or foreign commerce. As a result, states competed for control of commerce by levying their own tariffs on trade with foreign countries and even on trade with other states.  There was no provision for an independent executive branch or for a national court to handle disputes between citizens of different states."
8, 2," Land Ordinance of 1785","  The Land Ordinance of 1785 provided that the acreage of the Old Northwest (the area north and west of the Ohio River) should be sold and the proceeds used to pay off the national debt. The ordinance provided for surveying the frontier to make settlement simpler and prevent confusing legal disagreements over land. The ordinance made provision for funding public education."
8, 3," Northwest Ordinance of 1787","  The Northwest Ordinance established the procedures for territories becoming states on an equal basis with existing states. These procedures were applied to other territories acquired later. The ordinance also forbade slavery in the Old Northwest (that area north and west of the Ohio River). "
8, 4," Shays’s Rebellion","  Led by Captain Daniel Shays, the rebellion began in western Massachusetts; backcountry farmers were losing their farms through mortgage foreclosures and tax delinquencies.  They demanded cheap paper money, lower taxes, and a suspension of mortgage foreclosures. This rebellion struck fear in the hearts of the propertied class. It demonstrated the need for a stronger central government. "
8, 5," Annapolis Convention","  Virginia called the Annapolis convention in 1786 because of interstate squabbling over regulation of commerce. Only five states were represented. With such a poor showing, nothing could be done.  However, the Annapolis Convention followed Alexander Hamilton’s recommendation and called upon Congress to summon a convention to meet in Philadelphia the next year to deal with not only commerce but also the whole structure of the Articles of Confederation. "
8, 6," Virginia Plan","  Known as the ““large state plan,”“ the Virginia plan stated that representation in both houses of a bicameral legislature should be based on population, an arrangement that would naturally give the larger states an advantage."
8, 7," New Jersey Plan","  Known as the ““small state plan,”“ the New Jersey Plan provided equal representation in a unicameral congress by states regardless of size and population. The weaker states feared that under Virginia’s plan the larger states would control the rest. "
8, 8," Great Compromise","  Also known as the Connecticut Plan, this plan gave the larger states representation by population in the House of Representatives, and the smaller states equal representation in the Senate. Each state had two senators.  The large states would have to bear the major burden of taxation, so the delegates agreed that every tax measure must originate in the House where population counted more heavily.  "
8, 9," Three-Fifths Compromise","  Southern states wanted slaves counted for purposes of apportioning representation in the House but for not taxation. Northern states wanted slaves counted for taxation but not representation. The compromise was to count slaves as three-fifths of a free person for both representation and taxation."
8, 10," Slave Trade Compromise","  The agreement was that Congress could not ban slave trade (not slavery) until 1808. In addition, the Constitution forbade any state’s people from blocking the return of runaway slaves to another state. It also continued the earlier ban on slavery in the Old Northwest."
8, 11," Separation of Powers","  As a means of limiting the power of any one part of the government, the Constitution provided that the powers of the federal government be separated among three distinct branches.  The legislative branch, Congress, makes the laws. The executive branch headed by the president carries out the laws. The judicial branch, the court system, settles disputes by interpreting the meaning of the laws."
8, 12," Checks and Balances","  The Constitution enables each branch of the federal government to limit the powers of the other branches through a series of checks and balances.  The president can veto legislation, nominate judges, and grant pardons.  Congress can override vetoes, confirm or reject presidential appointments (e.g., nominations to the Supreme Court or nominations of ambassadors), ratify or reject treaties, and impeach members of the other two branches.  The judicial branch can declare actions of the executive branch unconstitutional and declare laws made by Congress unconstitutional.  "
8, 13," Expressed Powers","  These are powers explicitly granted to the federal government by the Constitution, e.g., the power to coin money."
8, 14," Implied Powers","  These are powers not explicitly granted by the Constitution but are powers derived from the elastic clause plus one or more of the expressed powers. For example, Congress has the expressed power to declare war. This implies that Congress has the power to establish a draft to provide soldiers for the military. "
8, 15," Necessary and Proper Clause","  Also known as the elastic clause, the Constitution grants Congress the power ““to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.”“ This is the basis of implied powers. For example, it was used to authorize a national bank."
8, 16," Reserved Powers ","  The powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution nor prohibited to the states are given to the states or people. For example, the states, not the federal government, control education, traffic laws, and laws regarding marriage and divorce.   This is another way the power of the federal government is limited."
8, 17," Concurrent Powers","  Concurrent powers are those powers given to both the federal government and the states. These include levying taxes, borrowing money, building roads, and maintaining courts.  "
8, 18," Federalism","  This is the dual system of government set up by the Constitution. It allows both the states and the federal government to directly govern the people.  This is one way the power of the federal government is limited."
8, 19," Antifederalists ","  They opposed the ratification of the Constitution because it gave more power to the federal government and less to the states, and because it did not ensure individual rights. The Antifederalists were instrumental in obtaining the promise of a bill of rights as a condition for ratifying the Constitution."
8, 20," The Federalist Papers","  This was a set of articles in New York newspapers by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. The intent was to persuade New York to ratify the Constitution. In Federalist #10, Madison explained that human nature follows self-interest and, as a result, people form factions or groups to pursue that self-interest. He argued that the Constitution set up a government likely to control the damaging effects of factions. In Federalist #51, Madison explained how the checks and balances system would prevent abuse of power by any one part of the government."
8, 21," Republican Motherhood","  This was the view in the Revolutionary War era that women had a special role in raising their children to be republican citizens trained in the virtues of civic life and ready to assume the duties of citizenship. Women were also to keep their husbands in line. This did not lead to political or legal equality for women. It did, however, lead to increased educational opportunities for women as they needed a certain amount of education if they were to educate their children and instill republican virtues. Key ID’s Ch. 9, 1789-1800 "
9, 1," Judiciary Act of 1789","  The Judiciary Act organized the Supreme Court (with a chief justice and five associates) as well as federal district and circuit courts. It established the office of Attorney General. John Jay became the first chief justice. "
9, 2," Tariff of 1789","  This was the first tariff law; it was very low, just 8% on the value of dutiable imports. It was passed to raise revenue for the federal government and was to protect infant industries. "
9, 3," Bill of Rights","  Several states ratified the Constitution with the proviso that a bill of rights be added to protect the rights of individuals from the power of the new federal government. In the first session of Congress, Representative James Madison introduced a set of amendments that were submitted to the states for ratification. Ten were approved in 1791.  Note that until 1925 when the Supreme Court began the process known as selective incorporation, the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states, only to the federal government."
9, 4," Excise Tax on Whiskey—1791","  This was designed to raise revenue for Hamilton’s funding and assumption program. The tax was paid chiefly by farmers in the West where bad roads made it hard to transport bulky crops such as grain; they distilled the grain into more condensed and easily transported whiskey."
9, 5," Funding Bill—1790 ","  The Funding Bill regarded the nation’s domestic debt. Speculators had purchased government bonds from their original owners at prices far below face value. The original owners (and those who would be paying the taxes to repay the debt, e.g., western farmers) protested that repaying the domestic debt in full would enrich the speculators. Hamilton successfully argued that the measure was necessary to establish the nation’s credit. The term funding ““at par”“ meant that the federal government would repay the bonds at face value plus accumulated interest. By doing this, Hamilton hoped to make the wealthy (who had purchased the bonds) financially interested in the success of the new government."
9, 6," Assumption Bill—1790 ","  Hamilton argued that the federal government should assume and repay the Revolutionary War debts of the states. By doing so, he hoped to bind the states more closely to the federal government. Southern states that had already taxed themselves and paid off their debts objected. Hamilton brokered a deal that located the national capital in the South in return for Southern support for his plan."
9, 7," Bank of the United States","  Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury, proposed the Bank of the United States. This Bank would issue paper currency, sell government bonds, and assist in tax collection. Thomas Jefferson opposed this idea, pointing out that Congress was not specifically authorized to establish a national bank by the Constitution.  Hamilton pointed out that the Bank was ““necessary and proper”“ for carrying out the delegated power ““to coin money”“ and ““regulate the value thereof.”“ George Washington, who signed the bill chartering the bank, accepted Hamilton’s loose interpretation of the Constitution.  This conflict between Hamilton and Jefferson over the Bank led to the development of competing political parties."
9, 8," Loose Construction (in a constitutional sense)","  Loose interpretation allows the government to do anything that the Constitution does not specifically forbid it from doing. Its constitutional basis is the elastic clause in Article I, Section 8."
9, 9," Strict Construction","  Strict interpretation forbids the government from doing anything except what the Constitution specifically empowers it to do. Its constitutional basis is the Tenth Amendment."
9, 10," First Party System, 1796 – 1828","  The framers of the Constitution hoped there would be no permanent political parties and Washington even warned against the dangers of parties, but the fight between Jefferson and Hamilton over the Bank of the United States led to what became known as the First Party System (or Era).  Jefferson and Madison were the leading figures for the Democratic-Republicans (also known as the Republicans, the Democrats, the Jeffersonians, and the Anti-Federalists). They formed the basis of what eventually became today’s Democratic Party.  Hamilton and John Adams were the leading figures for the Federalists. This party continued through the War of 1812, but the Hartford Convention and the shift in population away from New England resulted in their demise.  With the disappearance of the Federalists, the country entered what became known as the Era of Good Feelings, a period with only one political party."
9, 11," Federalist Party","  Led by John Adams and Alexander Hamilton. Favored a strong central government and a loose interpretation of the Constitution. Feared the excesses of democracy. Supported Hamilton’s economic program. Supported by merchants, bankers, and large landowners."
9, 12," Democratic-Republican Party","  Led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Favored states’ rights and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Feared the tyranny of a strong central government. Opposed Hamilton’s economic program. Supported by farmers, shopkeepers, and urban workers."
9, 13," Whiskey Rebellion—1794 ","  Farmers in Pennsylvania rebelled against Hamilton’s excise tax on whiskey, and several federal officers were killed in the riots caused by their attempts to serve arrest warrants on the offenders. The army, led by Washington, put down the rebellion.  The incident showed that the new government under the Constitution could react swiftly and effectively to such a problem, in contrast to the weakness of the government under the Articles of Confederation."
9, 14,"Treaty of Greenville—1795","  Encouraged by the British, Native Americans in the Ohio Valley had successfully pushed back US military efforts to control the area. But at the Battle of the Fallen Timbers in 1794, General Anthony Wayne defeated the Indians. The treaty opened the Ohio region to white settlement and, for a time, ended hostilities in the region between the US and Native Americans."
9, 15," Neutrality Proclamation—1793","  Washington urged Americans to be impartial in the conflict between Great Britain and France. He feared American involvement in the European war would be dangerous for the young nation.  Washington also feared that America would be called on for military assistance because of the Franco-American treaty of 1778. This was a beginning for the American tradition of isolationism."
9, 16," Citizen Edmond Genêt","  France’s ambassador to the US, Genêt was swayed by the pro-French enthusiasm of the Democratic-Republicans. Defying Washington’s Proclamation of Neutrality, he outfitted privateers in American harbors and commissioned them to raid British and Spanish ships and colonies.  Fearing that Genêt would involve America in the war, Washington ordered Genêt to halt his activities and eventually requested Genêt’s recall by the French government. "
9, 17," Jay’s Treaty—1795","  Britain seized American merchant ships bound for French ports, impressed American seamen into British naval service, and still held posts in the Northwest Territory (despite the promise to evacuate those forts made in the Treaty of Paris).  The treaty provided that Great Britain would withdraw her troops from the American Northwest. It also created commissions to settle financial claims of the two nations against each other.  This treaty was highly unpopular (Jay was burned in effigy) because it did not guarantee freedom of the seas or halt the seizure of American ships and impressment of American seamen. Nonetheless, the treaty did secure peace with Britain."
9, 18," Pinckney’s Treaty—1795","  In 1784 Spain closed New Orleans to American goods shipped down the Mississippi River. This meant that 100,000 Americans who lived west of the Appalachians could only move their goods to market by crossing the almost-roadless mountains. Talk of secession was heard. In addition, Spain and the US disputed the southern and western American boundaries. Jay’s Treaty led Spain to fear a secret Anglo-American alliance to seize Spanish territories. So Spain agreed to negotiate disputes it had with the US.  The resulting treaty established the Mississippi River as the westward boundary and the 31st parallel as the southern boundary of the United States, guaranteed the Americans free navigation of the Mississippi River, and the right of deposit in New Orleans. (The right of deposit was the right to transfer of goods from riverboat to ocean boat without paying a tariff to Spain.)"
9, 19," Washington’s Farewell Address—1796","  In foreign affairs, Washington urged developing of commercial relations with all nations but avoiding political entanglements. He stated that America should steer clear of any permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world but that temporary alliances were acceptable for extraordinary emergencies.  This address helped to solidify the policy of isolationism."
9, 20," French Revolution","  The Democratic-Republicans supported the French Revolution. They believed that the French were fighting for democracy; they had overthrown their king, written a declaration of the rights of man, and proclaimed democratic ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity.  The Federalists were unsympathetic toward the French and in the war between France and England generally sided with England. Federalists saw in the excesses of the French Revolution the lesson that it was dangerous to give too much power to the common people."
9, 21," XYZ Affair—1797","  Seeking to ease tensions with France, President Adams sent a delegation to Paris. The US delegation was told by three French intermediaries (known as X, Y, and Z) that if they wanted to meet with the French foreign minister, they would have to pay a huge bribe and make a $12 million loan to France. Americans were outraged. South Carolina Congressman Robert Goodloe Harper captured the national mood with his statement, ““Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute.”“  Republicans attempted to excuse French behavior; Federalists condemned the French and rode a wave of patriotism to victory in the 1798 elections."
9, 22," The Quasi War: Undeclared Naval War with France—1798-1800","  The US still had a treaty of alliance with France (1778), but Washington’s Neutrality Proclamation and Jay’s Treaty created tension with France. French warships seized hundreds of American merchant vessels. The US established a Department of the Navy, built warships, and captured over a hundred French vessels. Despite demands for war, President Adams relied on negotiations with Napoleon. The two sides agreed to end the naval conflict and to abrogate the 1778 treaty of alliance."
9, 23," Alien Act & Alien Enemies Act—1798","  These laws, along with the Sedition and Naturalization acts, were purportedly designed to deal with alien, especially French and Irish, agitators. In reality, they were Federalist efforts to weaken the Democratic-Republicans. The Alien Act empowered the president to arrest and deport dangerous aliens during peacetime. The Alien Enemies Act allowed for the detention and deportation of individuals from countries at war with the US if those persons were thought to be spies or saboteurs. Neither of these two laws was invoked by Adams."
9, 24," Naturalization Act—1798","  The Naturalization Act increased the waiting period for an immigrant to become a citizen from five to fourteen years. The Federalists passed this law because most immigrants, once citizens, became supporters of the Democratic-Republicans."
9, 25," Sedition Act—1798","  The Sedition Act made it illegal to publish defamatory statements about the federal government or its officials.  This law, unlike the other three, could be used against US citizens. Ten Republicans including a member of Congress were convicted under the Sedition Act."
9, 26," Virginia & Kentucky Resolutions—1798","  Kentucky and Virginia passed resolutions drafted by Jefferson and Madison condemning the Alien, Alien Enemies, Sedition, and Naturalization acts as unconstitutional.  The resolutions presented the states’ rights doctrine claiming that 1) the federal government was created by the states to serve as their agent and 2) state legislatures could declare laws of Congress unconstitutional and 3) since there are no legitimate implied powers, these acts were therefore null and void. "
9, 26," Virginia & Kentucky Resolutions—1798","  Key ID’s Ch. 10, 1800-1809 "
10, 1," Revolution of 1800","  Jefferson felt his election was a revolution in the sense of a return to the ideals of 1776. He favored agrarian interests over business, reduced government expenditures and debt, and repealed some Federalist legislation. More importantly, the election was a revolution in the sense that a peaceful transition of power from one party to another took place and was accepted by all."
10, 2," Twelfth Amendment","  The Twelfth Amendment said that electors (members of the Electoral College) were to cast separate ballots for president and vice president. According to the original Constitution, each elector voted for two persons. The candidate with the most votes became president and the runner-up the vice president. The framers had not anticipated the emergence of political parties. In the election of 1800, there was a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr; this amendment was meant to keep such a tie from occurring again.  "
10, 3," Midnight Judges","  In the election of 1800, the Federalists lost the presidency and much of Congress to the Republicans. The lame-duck Federalist Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, creating new federal judgeships in an attempt to retain control of one of the three branches of government. Adams worked until late in the evening of his last night in office filling these positions with Federalist appointees."
10, 4," John Marshall","  John Marshall was appointed by President John Adams as the chief justice to the Supreme Court. He served for thirty-four years.  Marshall was notable for his many decisions that solidified the power of the central government at the expense of the states. Marshall wrote the Marbury v. Madison decision that established the power of judicial review for the Supreme Court."
10, 5," Marbury v. Madison and Judicial Review—1803 ","  William Marbury, one of Adams’s last-minute judicial appointments, did not receive his commission. He sued Jefferson’s new secretary of state, James Madison, for its delivery, following the provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1789. Marshall dismissed the suit, giving Jefferson a victory. However, Marshall made this a victory for the power of the Supreme Court. He said that the Judiciary Act of 1789 on which Marbury was trying to base his appeal was unconstitutional. With this action, Marshall greatly magnified the authority of the court and gave the Supreme Court the last word on the question of constitutionality. In other words, this is the case that established the principle of judicial review."
10, 6," Tripolitan War/Barbary Pirates","  The rulers of several countries on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa had long demanded tribute in exchange for refraining from attacking ships in the Mediterranean. From 1795-1801, the U.S. paid these states for protection against the Barbary pirates. Jefferson stopped paying the tribute, and the U.S. fought the Barbary Wars (1801-1805) against the countries of Tripoli, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria.  After four years of fighting, Jefferson succeeded in acquiring a treaty of peace. It was secured at a price of $60,000, a sum representing ransom payment for captured Americans, about half the amount that the US had been paying annually. "
10, 7," Toussaint L’Ouverture","  L’Ouverture led an army of ex-slaves against Napoleon when he tried to recapture the island of Santo Domingo. Aided by yellow fever, L’Ouverture turned back the French. This defeat at the hands of L’Ouverture and Napoleon’s fear that Britain might take control of Louisiana led Napoleon to sell Louisiana to America."
10, 8," Constitutionality of Louisiana Purchase—1803 ","  Thomas Jefferson purchased 828,000 square miles of land for 15 million dollars from Napoleon. But the Constitution did not expressly grant the president the power to purchase territory, and Jefferson was a strict constructionist. Jefferson considered asking for a constitutional amendment to legitimize the purchase. But he feared that Napoleon would change his mind, so he submitted the treaty to the Senate, which enthusiastically approved it. In doing so, Jefferson adopted Hamilton’s doctrine of implied powers."
10, 9," Lewis and Clark—1804-1806","  This expedition solidified the American claim to the Oregon territory, brought back a wealth of scientific and geographical data, and stimulated interest in settlement of the West."
10, 10," Zebulon Pike—1805, 1806","  Pike’s two expeditions into the Louisiana Territory up the Mississippi and into Colorado also encouraged settlement. "
10, 11," British Orders in Council—1806-1807","  Britain, at war again with France, issued the Orders in Council, restricting the trade of neutral nations (such as the US) with France by closing all French ports to foreign shipping, including American, unless the vessels first stopped at a British port. There they would pay the necessary fees, and if acceptable, secure clearance papers."
10, 12," Berlin & Milan Decrees—1806-1807","  The French similarly blocked trade of neutral nations with Britain. Napoleon ordered any ship entering British ports to be seized. As a result of the Orders in Council and the Berlin and Milan decrees, US foreign trade was severely limited. However, those American captains who managed to reach European ports successfully received top prices for their cargoes, and Americans continued to send ships to sea. "
10, 13," Impressment","  Britain claimed the right to board ships, seize deserters from the British navy, and press them back into military service. The British navy would even seize US-born seamen and former Britons who had become American citizens, as well as British citizens. Between 1808 and 1811, 6,000 Americans were impressed by Britain."
10, 14," Chesapeake Affair—1807","  A British ship, the Leopard, fired on a US military vessel, the Chesapeake, off the Virginia coast. British forces boarded the Chesapeake and seized four men, one a deserter; the other three were US citizens. This outraged the nation. But Jefferson sought peace, first through fruitless negotiations with Britain and then through the Embargo Act."
10, 15," Embargo Act—1807","  This act forbade American trading vessels from leaving the US and forbade US exports to any country. It was meant to force Britain and France to change their policies towards neutral vessels by depriving them of American trade.  The Embargo Act severely damaged the New England shipping as well as agricultural producers in the South and West.  The Embargo did, however, stimulate domestic industry since foreign products were not available."
10, 16," Non-Intercourse Act—1809","  Faced with widespread opposition to the Embargo Act, Congress replaced it with the Non-Intercourse Act. This new act opened trade with all nations except France and Britain. It promised to restore trade with those two countries if they stopped violating neutral rights.  They did not.    Key ID’s Ch. 11, 1809–1815 "
11, 1," Macon’s Bill No. 2—1810 ","  Macon’s Bill No. 2 replaced the Non-Intercourse Act. It allowed trade with all nations including Britain and France. But it promised to reimpose a trade embargo against either of the warring nations if the other lifted its trade restrictions and promised to respect America’s neutral rights. Later that year, Napoleon said the French commercial restrictions would be lifted. But he attached the contingency that the British Orders in Council must also be lifted, a contingency that essentially made his offer meaningless. Nevertheless, in February of 1811, Madison reestablished non-intercourse against Britain (even though the French continued to seize American ships). Britain refused to repeal its Orders in Council, and Madison recalled the American ambassador to England. The continued tension over trade between the US and Britain was a key factor in the US decision to declare war against Britain in June of 1812."
11, 2," War Hawks","  These were a group of young, pro-war members of Congress first elected in 1810 and led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. The war hawks favored war as a means of dealing with the threat posed by Native Americans (thought to be supported by the British), of responding to British insults to America’s neutral rights, and of expanding American territory by conquering Canada and Florida (held by Britain’s ally, Spain)."
11, 3," Tecumseh and the Prophet","  Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief, and his brother Tenskwatawa, known as the Prophet, sought to halt the flood of whites into the Ohio and Indiana territories. They urged Indians to return to traditional ways and renounce alcohol. They pledged not to cede any land to whites unless all Indians agreed."
11, 4," William Henry Harrison","  In 1811, Harrison, the governor of Indiana Territory, led an army against Tecumseh and the Prophet. He was victorious at the Battle of Tippecanoe. As a result, Harrison became a national hero (and later president). The defeat forced Tecumseh into an alliance with the British."
11, 5," USS Constitution (Old Ironsides)","  The Constitution won more battles than any other early American naval vessel, most notably against the British warship Guerrière in 1812. Americans ships on the whole were more skillfully handled, had better gunners, and were manned by nonpress-gang crews who were eager to avenge violations of neutral rights by Britain."
11, 6," Oliver H. Perry—1813 ","  American invasions of Canada in the War of 1812 were fruitless, but Captain Perry’s naval victory on Lake Erie (““We have met the enemy and they are ours.”“) inspired the nation."
11, 7," Thomas Macdonough—1814","  The British attempted an invasion through the New York lake-and-river route. Macdonough won a significant naval battle on Lake Champlain—the Battle of Plattsburgh. Macdonough’s victory at Plattsburgh saved New York from conquest, kept New England from drifting away from the Union, and strengthened the position of American peace negotiators in Europe."
11, 8," Battle of New Orleans—1815","  A large British invasion force was repelled by Andrew Jackson’s troops at New Orleans. About 2500 British soldiers were killed or captured, while in the American army only eight men were killed.  The Treaty of Ghent had ended the War of 1812 two weeks before the battle. Nonetheless, this victory inspired American nationalism and made Jackson a national hero (and later president). "
11, 9," Hartford Convention—1814 ","  This was a convention of New England Federalists hurt by trade restrictions and who opposed the War of 1812. They proposed several amendments to the Constitution (repeal of the Three-fifths Compromise to limit Southern representation in Congress and a requirement of a two-thirds vote in Congress to declare war, admit new states, or impose a long-term embargo). They also discussed (but rejected) the idea of seceding from the US if their desires were ignored.  News of the Hartford Convention arrived in Washington at the same time as news of Jackson’s victory. This talk seemed disloyal; it turned public sentiment against the Federalists and led to the demise of the party. "
11, 10," Treaty of Ghent—1814 ","  The treaty essentially restored the pre-war conditions. The two sides agreed to stop fighting and return to pre-war boundaries.  No mention was made of neutral rights, but the war between France and Britain had ended, so these were no longer pressing issues.    Key ID’s Ch. 12, 1815-1824 "
12, 1," Rush-Bagot Agreement—1817","  This treaty between the US and Great Britain provided for the mutual disarmament of the Great Lakes. This was later expanded into an unarmed Canada/US border. This agreement was significant as a sign of improved relations between the two nations and as an early example of arms control."
12, 2," Second Bank of the United States—1816","  In 1811 the charter for the first BUS had expired. Following that state banks had filled the void, issuing unsound paper money. In addition, the federal government lacked a secure depository for its funds. The Second BUS was approved by Congress, this time with support from the Democratic-Republicans who now saw the BUS as in the nation’s interest."
12, 3," Tariff of 1816","  Earlier tariffs had been designed to provide revenue; this one was intended to protect American infant industries from British competition by imposing higher rates. This tariff imposed rates averaging 20% to 25%."
12, 4," American System—1824  ","  Henry Clay proposed a system of government programs that would benefit and link together all parts of the nation. He proposed a protective tariff and a strong banking system to stimulate northeastern manufacturing. Revenues from the tariff would finance a system of roads and canals to allow southern and western farmers to transport their crops to market easily and to allow the return flow of eastern manufactured goods."
12, 5," Bonus Bill—1817","  John C. Calhoun proposed his Bonus Bill which would use the bonus and dividends paid to the national government by the Second Bank of the United States as a $1.5 million fund for internal improvements to be allocated to the states.  President Madison vetoed the bill, saying that the Constitution did not expressly give Congress the power to fund internal improvements."
12, 6," Era of Good Feelings—1816-1824","  The years following the end of the War of 1812 have been called the ““Era of Good Feelings”“ because of their apparent lack of partisan political strife. In the election of 1816, James Monroe trounced Rufus King, the last of the Federalist candidates. Monroe was overwhelmingly reelected in the election of 1820 with no opposition whatsoever. Despite the lack of party conflict, this was a time of increasing sectional tension over tariffs, internal improvements, and slavery."
12, 7," Nationalism","  The War of 1812 had stimulated a sense of national pride. This was manifested in the continued construction of the capitol in Washington, in the emergence of a new national literature (Cooper, Irving), and in a willingness to expand the powers of the federal government for economic development."
12, 8," Panic of 1819 & Wildcat Banks","  This was largely caused by over-speculation in western lands. State (wildcat) banks had issued paper currency not supported by specie (gold or silver) and had extended easy credit, encouraging farmers and speculators to buy more land.  When business conditions took a downturn, the BUS demanded wildcat banks redeem their notes in specie. When they could not do so, the wildcat banks required the repayment of the loans they had made. This led to foreclosures and a dramatic drop in land prices. This resulted in a mistrust of banks and in a demand for higher protective tariffs for American products."
12, 9," Robert Fulton & Steamboats","  In 1807 Fulton’s Clermont demonstrated the viability of steamboat transportation by traveling upriver from New York City to Albany in thirty-two hours. Upstream transportation was now possible at ten times previous speeds, lowering prices dramatically. The West and South could, as a result, export agricultural products and import manufactured goods more cheaply, stimulating the economies of those regions."
12, 10," Tallmadge Amendment—1819","  This measure sought to block admission of Missouri as a slave state by blocking further importation of slaves into the state and requiring the gradual emancipation of existing slaves. The South managed to defeat the amendment in the Senate. But this raised Southern concerns that the North might try to ban slavery in the rest of the Louisiana Territory and perhaps even attack slavery in the South."
12, 11," Missouri Compromise—1820","  To maintain the sectional balance between North and South, Missouri was allowed to enter the Union as a slave state at the same time Maine entered as a free state.  Also, the Louisiana Purchase north of 36 30′, except Missouri, was closed to slavery. "
12, 12," McCulloch v. Maryland—1819","  Maryland had taxed the BUS $15,000 per year because it didn’t want out-of-state banks competing with in-state banks. Maryland argued that the federal government was created by sovereign states, and the powers of the federal government had been delegated to it by the states. Therefore, the federal government should do as the states said. However, Chief Justice Marshall supported the federal government. He ruled that Congress is granted the expressed powers to collect taxes and borrow money; it also may make laws necessary and proper for carrying out expressed powers. Congress, furthermore, is not explicitly forbidden from creating a bank. Therefore, the BUS was constitutional.  This case established the principles of national supremacy (if there is a conflict between the federal government and the state governments when both are acting legally, the federal government prevails) and implied powers (the federal government can do whatever is necessary and proper to carry out the expressed powers granted by the Constitution)."
12, 13," Cohens v. Virginia—1821","  Philip and Mendes Cohen had broken a Virginia law that forbade the selling of lottery tickets that were not state-authorized. The Cohens were arrested for selling lottery tickets from Washington, D.C. Virginia won the case, but Chief Justice Marshall again asserted the power of the central government over the states. In this case, he ruled that the Supreme Court has the power to exercise its appellate jurisdiction over the judgment of a state court involving the validity of state legislation. "
12, 14," Gibbons v. Ogden —1824","  Ogden had been licensed by New York to run a steamboat between New York and New Jersey. Gibbons had been licensed by Congress to do the same. Ogden tried to force Gibbons to stop. NY courts agreed, and Gibbons appealed to the Supreme Court. In this case, Marshall gave the concept of commerce a broad interpretation. That is, commerce is not limited to buying and selling commodities. In this decision, Marshall reaffirmed that only Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, that is, business that crosses state lines. "
12, 15," Fletcher v. Peck—1810","  The state of Georgia in 1796 passed a law repealing a 1795 Georgia law authorizing a land sale that transferred 35 million acres of land to speculators for 1 1/2¢/acre. The law was repealed because of massive bribery and corruption in the legislature. Chief Justice Marshall overturned the 1796 law, saying that the earlier law, fraudulent though it was, was a legally binding contract and that the state could not impair or alter a contract. "
12, 16," Dartmouth College v. Woodward—1819","  The New Hampshire legislature changed Dartmouth College’s charter and placed the college under state control. Marshall ruled the original charter must stand; it was a contract and the Constitution protected contracts against state encroachment.  This decision encouraged economic development by ensuring corporations that they would be free from arbitrary interference from government once their charters were established. But the decision had the negative effect of shielding corporations from public control."
12, 17," Treaty of 1818","  This treaty fixed the boundary line between the United States and Canada at the 49th parallel from Lake of the Woods (northern Minnesota) to the Rocky Mountains.  The treaty also provided that the United States and Britain would jointly occupy the Oregon country for a period of ten years and decreed that the US and Canada would share the valuable Newfoundland fisheries. "
12, 18," Andrew Jackson in Florida—1818","  Arguing that Seminole Indians and runaway slaves were using Spanish Florida as a refuge from US law, Jackson obtained permission to take a military force into Florida. Once there, Jackson exceeded the limits of his authority, hanging Indians and British subjects and seizing Spanish posts. Though most in Washington were ready to disavow Jackson, Secretary of State J.Q. Adams seized the opportunity to press Spain for concessions."
12, 19," Adams-Onis Florida Purchase Treaty—1819","  In the resulting treaty of 1819, Spain, realizing that Jackson might seize all of Florida, ceded Florida to the US for $5 million. In exchange for the US dropping its weak claim to Texas, Spain gave up its claim to the Oregon territory and set the boundary between Oregon and Mexico at the 42nd parallel."
12, 20," Monroe Doctrine—1823","  Latin American nations had overthrown Spanish rule. The US sought to keep powerful European colonial powers out of its backyard, and US merchants sought to build up trade with Latin American nations (not possible if a mercantilist colonial power controlled the area). The basic principles of the Monroe Doctrine were 1) the Western Hemisphere was closed to further European colonization, 2) the United States would not interfere with the existing colonies of any European power, 3) the United States would not interfere in the internal affairs of any European power, and 4) any attempt by European powers to intervene in the Western Hemisphere would be regarded as a threat to the US. This was welcomed by Americans as an expression of nationalism and isolationism. Fortunately for the US, the British also wanted to keep other colonial powers out of the hemisphere; the British navy provided the enforcement for this doctrine in its first decades. "
12, 21," 54°40′/ Russo-American Treaty—1824","  The first success of the Monroe Doctrine was the Russian decision to halt their expansion in the Western Hemisphere at 5440′, the southern tip of the Alaskan panhandle. Key ID’s Ch. 13, 1824-1830 "
13, 1," King Numbers","  This term referred to the masses obtaining more political power under President Jackson."
13, 2," The Election of 1824/Favorite Sons","  There were four candidates running in the presidential race in 1824: Jackson, Adams, Clay, and Crawford, each a favorite son of a particular region of the country. None of these four candidates was able to win a majority in the Electoral College vote, so the House of Representatives chose from the top three candidates.  Although Jackson led in the popular and electoral vote counts, he lost in the House vote when Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams, who was then elected on the first ballot."
13, 3," The Corrupt Bargain—1825","  Shortly after Adams won the presidential vote in the House, he announced the appointment of Clay as Secretary of State, an office widely seen as the stepping stone to the White House. Jackson’s supporters immediately charged that a corrupt bargain between Adams and Clay had deprived Jackson of victory. There was no evidence of any explicit bargain, and there certainly was no corruption involved. Yet this charge weakened Adams during his presidency and rallied support for Jackson."
13, 4," Second Party System, 1828 – 1860","  The battle over the disputed election of 1824 with the so-called Corrupt Bargain led to a split in the Democratic-Republicans. By 1828, the Second Party System (or Era) was forming.  Andrew Jackson and his followers formed the Democrats. This is today’s Democratic Party.  John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster, at first known as the National Republicans, soon called themselves the Whigs. In British politics, the Whigs had opposed the power of the king, and American Whigs were opposed to what they saw as the autocratic rule of King Andrew Jackson. (The Whigs eventually split and disappeared over the issue of slavery.)  Whereas voter turnout had been relatively low in the First Party System, under the Second Party System both Democrats and Whigs worked hard to increase political participation through the use of torchlight parades, mass rallies, and freely flowing alcohol. Voter participation increased dramatically.  Yes, there were later party eras as well. The Republicans dominated national politics from 1860 to 1932, and the Democrats dominated from 1932 to 1968. The current era from 1968 to the present is described by most political scientists as an era of divided government with the country closely divided and neither party consistently dominating national politics."
13, 5," Tariff of Abominations—1828","  In an attempt to win votes for Jackson in the election of 1828, his supporters in Congress proposed a high tariff (45%) on imports of raw materials and manufactured goods. The tariff passed. The South hated the tariff, calling it the Tariff of Abominations.  They felt that high tariffs essentially taxed the South to help the North by raising the price of imported manufactured goods. The South also feared that if the North could force them to pay a high tariff, it might also interfere with the institution of slavery."
13, 6," South Carolina Exposition & Protest—1828 ","  In response to the Tariff of Abominations, John C. Calhoun secretly wrote the South Carolina Exposition and Protest. This document, based on the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions, presented the following arguments: 1) the federal government was created by the states to serve their interests, 2) states have the power to declare laws of Congress unconstitutional, 3) laws so declared unconstitutional are null and void.  Calhoun also believed that, as a last resort, a state could terminate its compact with the other states and secede from the Union. "
13, 7," The Election of 1828—Sectionalism","  The election returns in 1828 showed the country increasingly divided on sectional lines. Adams doubled Jackson’s vote total in New England. Jackson doubled Adams’s vote in the South and nearly tripled it in the Southwest. "
13, 8," Revolution of 1828","  Jackson was the first non-aristocrat to be elected president; he was the first President to come from a poor family and to have received little formal education.   His election was a victory for the common man, the small farmer and city worker over the elite. The common people viewed Jackson as one of their own. Since Jackson opposed special privilege and campaigned as the champion of the people, his election is referred to as the Revolution of 1828.  "
13, 9," King Mob ","  The inelegant scene at Jackson’s inauguration led conservatives to fear that Jackson’s election marked the rise of the vulgar mob, the common rabble, to political power."
13, 10," Old Man Eloquent","  After he left the White House, John Quincy Adams served seventeen years in the House of Representatives where he was a strong voice for free speech and against slavery."
13, 11," Spoils System","  The spoils system awarded public offices to supporters of the winning candidate.  Jackson was an enthusiastic advocate of the spoils system, arguing that most government jobs were simple enough that ordinary people could fill them. (Note that some earlier presidents such as Jefferson had actually replaced a larger percentage of office holders on reaching the White House.) Jackson also felt that rotation in office would prevent the establishment of an entrenched bureaucratic class unresponsive to public interests."
13, 12," Maysville Road Veto—1830","  Jackson believed that Congress could legally appropriate money only for objectives that benefited all Americans, national defense, for example. Accordingly, he vetoed an appropriation for the Maysville Road, a project solely within the state of Kentucky. (It should be noted that Jackson signed more such bills than he vetoed.)"
13, 13," Eaton Affair—1830","  Secretary of War Eaton married the daughter of a tavern owner and boardinghouse keeper; the daughter Peggy was accused of scandalous behavior with various male boarders. Consequently, the ladies of Jackson’s cabinet, most obviously Vice President Calhoun’s wife, snubbed her. Jackson’s wife had been tainted by scandalous rumors during the presidential campaign; sympathetic, Jackson tried to force the social acceptance of Mrs. Eaton. Relations with Calhoun soured; Calhoun resigned the vice-presidency the next year and entered the Senate for South Carolina.  At the Jefferson Day Banquet, Jackson challenged Calhoun with his famous toast, ““Our Union: It must be preserved.”“ Calhoun replied, ““The Union: Next to our liberty, most dear.”“  This set the stage for the clash over nullification. "
13, 14," Webster-Hayne Debate—1830","  In a dispute over the sale of public lands, Senator Hayne of South Carolina presented the states’ rights position in Senate debate as outlined in Calhoun’s Exposition and Protest.  Senator Webster of Massachusetts responded with the nationalist view: the Constitution and federal government were created by the people, not by the states; the Supreme Court, not the states, is the only agency for determining the constitutionality of a law; and no state has the right to nullify a federal law or secede from the Union. Webster concluded with the words, ““Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.”“                                "
13, 14," Webster-Hayne Debate—1830","      Key ID’s Ch. 14 "
14, 1," Tariff of 1832","  A new tariff to modify the old Tariff of Abominations, this lowered the rate from 45% to 35%. Southerners were still dissatisfied with the high rates of this protective tariff."
14, 2," South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification—1832","  A state convention in South Carolina passed this in response to the Tariff of 1832; it made void the new tariff as well as the Tariff of Abominations. South Carolina threatened secession if the federal government attempted to collect the tariff duties within South Carolina."
14, 3," Force Bill—1833","  Jackson responded strongly to South Carolina’s nullification. Nullification itself, he said, was unconstitutional. Further, Jackson threatened to use the military to enforce national laws in South Carolina if needed. The Force Bill authorized President Jackson to use the army and navy to collect duties on the tariffs of 1828 and 1832.  The Force Act was never invoked because it was passed by Congress the same day as the Compromise Tariff of 1833, so it became unnecessary. South Carolina did, however, pass an ordinance nullifying the Force Bill. "
14, 4," Henry Clay’s Compromise of 1833","  Henry Clay devised the Compromise Tariff of 1833; over several years it gradually reduced the rates levied under the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 back to the level of the 1816 tariff.  This compromise caused South Carolina to withdraw the ordinance nullifying the tariffs of 1828 and 1832. "
14, 5," Veto of the 2nd Bank of U.S.—1832","  Henry Clay attempted to push a re-charter of the bank through Congress, four years before its charter expired; he was hoping this would secure his bid for presidency.  Jackson vetoed the bill. Unlike previous presidential vetoes that had been based on the premise that the bill in question was unconstitutional, Jackson based this veto primarily on his belief that the BUS was bad policy. (In addition, he did argue that the BUS was unconstitutional, ignoring the Supreme Court’s McCulloch v. Maryland decision.)  Opponents of the BUS complained that the Bank a) prevented state banks from issuing currency that would cause inflation, b) did not make loans to farmers and businessmen who lacked adequate collateral, c) was unconstitutional since there was no expressed power authorizing such a bank, d) made loans to friendly politicians, and e) enabled an economic elite to control the nation’s credit and currency for their self-interest."
14, 6," Nicholas Biddle ","  The brilliant but arrogant president of the BUS, Biddle saw himself as a public servant whose job it was to run the Bank without concern for politics. "
14, 7," Election of 1832","  Jackson’s enemies made the Bank the biggest issue of the election, hoping to win the presidency. Jackson’s veto alienated the aristocracy (which, due to the rise of Jacksonian democracy, had less influence than before), but united the common people for him. Jackson won the election, receiving 219 electoral votes to Clay’s 49."
14, 8," Anti-Masonic Party’s Influence on National Politics—1832","  The Anti-Masonic Party was the first third party in American political history. This group was first to hold a national nominating convention. This was one element in the increasing democratization of the Jacksonian era. They were also the first party to adopt a formal platform laying out the party’s views."
14, 9," Pet Banks","  Jackson saw his reelection as a mandate to destroy the BUS. So beginning in 1833, he withdrew government funds from the BUS and deposited them in various state banks, called pet banks by Jackson’s critics. The pet banks made loans unsecured by adequate collateral and issued more paper money than they could redeem in specie."
14, 10," Indian Removal Act—1830 ","  In response to white demands for Indian lands in the southeastern states, President Jackson pushed through Congress the Indian Removal Act. This act gave the president the power to negotiate treaties with tribes exchanging their lands east of the Mississippi for new lands further west. Tribes that agreed were promised financial assistance to help with the move and were guaranteed that the new lands would be theirs forever. Jackson signed over seventy such treaties removing over 50,000 Native Americans and opening up millions of acres in Georgia and neighboring states to white settlement. Other results of the Indian Removal Act were the Trail of Tears and the bloody and costly Seminole Wars. (The Seminoles of Florida fought for several decades to resist removal.) "
14, 11," Worcester v. Georgia—1832","  In this case, John Marshall ruled that the Cherokees were a distinct political community (separate from the state of Georgia) who could not be removed from their lands without their consent. Further, he said, the tribe was entitled to federal protection against Georgia’s actions. Jackson, whose platform had endorsed Indian removal, is said to have responded, ““John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.”“ In 1838 the Cherokees were forcibly moved across the Mississippi along what came to be known as the Trail of Tears. "
14, 12," Trail of Tears—1838–1839","  Despite the Cherokees’ effort to follow the advice of Jefferson and other white leaders to adopt white civilization, when gold was discovered on Cherokee land, it was decided to move them from their homes in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama to new lands across the Mississippi. One hundred thousand Indians were uprooted and marched hundreds of miles. Many died on the trail while on their way to the newly established Indian Territory (Oklahoma)."
14, 13," Stephen Austin—Texas","  Hoping to populate this northern province, Mexico invited American settlers to Texas. Stephen Austin was given permission in 1823 to bring 300 families, provided they adopted the Catholic religion and Mexican customs. They didn’t. In 1830 Mexico emancipated its slaves and forbade further importation of slaves to Texas. Tensions arose as Mexico also tried to halt further immigration into Texas and deprive Texas of self-governance. In 1833 Austin was jailed when he attempted to negotiate these issues with the Mexican government."
14, 14," Texas War for Independence—1836","  Sam Houston led a rebellion that defeated the Mexican forces in a few months. After the Texan victory at San Jacinto, Mexican General Santa Anna was forced to sign treaties withdrawing troops from Texas and setting the Rio Grande as Texas’s southern border. Texas then applied for annexation to the US, but concern over the issue of adding such a large slave territory to the nation postponed Texas annexation until 1845. "
14, 15," Whig Party & Election of 1836","  The Whigs were united primarily by their hatred of Jackson and what they saw as his executive usurpation. They were unable to agree on a single presidential candidate. Their plan was to endorse several favorite sons who would scatter the vote so no candidate would get the majority vote. The deadlock would go to the House of Representatives where the Whigs might have a chance.  Van Buren, Jackson’s Democratic successor, won anyway. "
14, 16," Specie Circular—1836","  In response to the unsound economic practices of the pet banks and wildcat banks, Jackson issued the Specie Circular, requiring that all purchases of public lands be paid for with gold or silver (specie). This helped to cause the Panic of 1837.  "
14, 17," Panic of 1837—Van Buren","  State banks were unable to meet the demand for hard currency brought on by Jackson’s Specie Circular. Land speculators lost money as land prices plummeted. Banks foreclosed on loans and shut their doors. Britain, responding to domestic economic problems, called in foreign loans. This severe financial depression lasted for several years. Wages dropped by a third. Unemployment shot up."
14, 18," Independent Treasury/Divorce Bill—1840","  On the assumption that depositing federal funds in private banks had helped to bring on the rage of speculation, President Van Buren proposed divorcing the federal government from banking.  He convinced Congress to establish several independent treasuries where the government could lock up its funds. This did reduce the speculative fever. It also reduced the amount of money available to businesses for legitimate loans."
14, 19," Election of 1840","  Blamed for the Panic of 1837 and depression, Van Buren was swept from office. The Whig party won, making William Henry Harrison president and John Tyler vice president. This election was significant for two reasons: 1) It marked the triumph of a populist democratic style in politics—slogans, mass rallies, torchlight parades, the ““Log Cabin and Hard Cider”“ campaign. 2) It marked the beginning of a durable and vigorous two-party system."
14, 20," Preemption Act—1841 ","  It gave squatters the first right to purchase at minimum price lands they had occupied and improved. This was an economic aspect of Jacksonian democracy.  Key ID’s Ch. 15, 1790–1869 "
15, 1," Irish Immigration in 1840’s","  Two million Irish died in the Potato Famine, which began in 1845. Britain continued to deny Ireland self-rule. One million Irish came to the US in the ten-year period starting in 1845. Lacking the money to move west and buy farms, the Irish settled in eastern cities where they performed manual labor or domestic work. These concentrations of Irish made them attractive to politicians who wooed their votes."
15, 2," Irish Workers ","  The Irish were seen as willing to work for low wages, thus forcing down wages in general. In addition, the Irish often encountered a strong anti-Catholic bias. The Irish in turn often resented black workers, with whom they competed for low-wage jobs."
15, 3," Molly Maguires","  The Ancient Order of Hibernians, a group started in Ireland to protect tenants from abusive landlords, helped to found the Molly Maguires, an Irish miners’ union that fought coal companies in Pennsylvania in the 1860’s and 1870’s."
15, 4," Twisting the British Lion’s Tail","  Politicians seeking Irish votes often engaged in demagogic attacks on Britain simply to arouse support."
15, 5," German Immigration in 1840’s","  Many were farmers displaced by crop failures. Others were political liberals fleeing the failed democratic revolutions of 1848. More financially secure than the Irish, German immigrants generally moved into the Midwest and bought land for farming.  German immigrants added several features to American culture: the Christmas tree, the Conestoga wagon, and the Kentucky rifle. They also tended to be supporters of public schools, music, and art; they generally opposed slavery."
15, 6," American or Know-Nothing Party","  The Order of the Star-Spangled Banner was formed in 1849 to oppose the influence of Catholic immigrants from Ireland and, in smaller numbers, Germany. By 1850 Roman Catholics became the country’s largest religious denomination. The concern was that Catholic immigrants would outbreed and outvote native Protestants. The OSSB soon developed into the American or Know-Nothing Party. The Know-Nothings pressed for restrictions on immigration and naturalization and for the deportation of alien paupers.  Another focus of the Know-Nothing Party was the elimination of parochial (religious) schools. Irish Catholic immigrants objected to what they saw as Protestant indoctrination in the public schools. Rather than allow their tax dollars to support this indoctrination, they petitioned to have tax dollars support parochial schools or, failing that, to open privately funded parochial schools. The Know-Nothings countered that this would lead to control of education by the Pope and would be detrimental to democracy. Mob violence against Catholics was not uncommon. "
15, 7," Samuel Slater","  Called the ““Father of the Factory System,”“ Samuel Slater emigrated from Britain in 1791, recreated from memory the English textile machines, and built the first American cotton mill."
15, 8," Eli Whitney","  In 1793 Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin (short for engine), which separated the seed from cotton fibers. This was fifty times more efficient than the handpicking method. Raising cotton became profitable, and slavery, which had been dying out, became more profitable. In 1798 Whitney also developed the concept of interchangeable parts in manufacturing. "
15, 9," Samuel F. B. Morse","  In 1844 Morse demonstrated the ability of his telegraph to communicate over long distances."
15, 10," Elias Howe & Isaac Singer","  Howe invented the sewing machine in 1848; the machine was perfected by Singer. The sewing machine became the cornerstone of the ready-made clothing industry, which surfaced about the same time as the Civil War and pulled seamstresses out of the home and into factories."
15, 11," Commonwealth v. Hunt—1842 ","  The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that labor unions were not illegal conspiracies.  This decision had limited impact, however, since less than 1% of workers belonged to unions at the time. In addition, employers ignored the ruling, often firing union organizers and replacing them with cheap immigrant labor."
15, 12," The Boston Associates & Lowell Mills","  In an attempt to secure the economic benefits of industrialization without the moral decay that Jeffersonians feared would accompany factories, young, native-born women were recruited to come to Lowell where they were closely supervised on and off the job by watchful matrons. The women were required to attend church, were provided with lectures and other intellectual opportunities, and were forbidden to join unions. After a time, these women became unhappy with factory conditions and were replaced by immigrant families."
15, 13," Cult of Domesticity","  Beginning in the 1840’s, the cult of domesticity was a widespread cultural creed that glorified the traditional functions of the homemaker. Women were thought to have special gifts in the areas of religion and child raising. From their pedestal, married women commanded moral power; they were to use this power to shape the family. In the 1880’s and 90’s, the cult of domesticity expanded. Women were to develop an artistic environment in the home that would lead to cultural enrichment for the family."
15, 14," Domestic Feminism","  Domestic feminism referred to women asserting their power to have fewer children. It signified the growing power and independence of women within the cult of domesticity."
15, 15," John Deere","  In 1837 Deere created the first steel plow to plow the thickly-matted soil of the West. Sharp and effective, it was light enough to be pulled by horses rather than oxen."
15, 16," McCormick Reaper","  In 1834 McCormick patented and in 1847 started mass-producing the first mechanical mower-reaper for harvesting grain. This horse-drawn machine allowed one man to do the work of five or six. Developments such as Deere’s plow and McCormick’s reaper encouraged farmers to expand production. This increased pressure for the nation to acquire more land. "
15, 17," Erie Canal—1825","  The Erie Canal linked the farms of the Midwest with the markets of New York City via the Great Lakes and the Hudson River.  Shipping costs dropped to 5% of previous rates, and transportation was more than three times as fast. This encouraged the agricultural development of the Midwest and the industrial development of New England (since marginal farms in New England could not compete with cheaper Erie-shipped goods)."
15, 18," Donald McKay & Clipper Ships","  In the 1840’s, McKay and other shipbuilders began producing clipper ships, very fast ships but with limited cargo capacity. They were notably successful in transporting tea from China and gold seekers to California. By the Civil War, steam-powered ships replaced the clipper ships."
15, 19," The Market Revolution, 1815-1860","  In the period after the War of 1812, the US economy went through a transformation referred to as the Market Revolution. Instead of farmers simply growing crops to feed their families and making clothing and other products for their own use, more farmers started producing a surplus crop to sell and industry expanded production, reducing prices of manufactured goods. In other words, fewer Americans were part of self-sufficient family-sized economic units and more were part of a national market economy. The Market Revolution was stimulated by the Embargo Act and the War of 1812, which cut off supplies of European goods and encouraged domestic manufacturing. Other key factors in the Market Revolution included the expansion of transportation systems to get goods to market (turnpikes [toll roads], canals, steamboats, and railroads), changes in manufacturing (Slater’s textile mills, the Lowell factory system), technological advances (the cotton gin, interchangeable parts, the McCormick reaper, John Deere’s steel plow), and faster communications (telegraph).    Key ID’s Ch. 16, 1790-1860 "
16, 1," Unitarianism","  An offshoot of deism, Unitarianism argued that human nature was essentially good, that humans had free agency, and that salvation could be attained through good works. This was a rational, optimistic approach to religion. Unitarianism was one foundation of the reform movements of the 1830’s to the 1850’s."
16, 2," The Second Great Awakening ","  This movement began around 1800 primarily in the West and spread to the masses (elites were largely unaffected) by camp meetings.  More people were affected than by the First Great Awakening. It affected women more than men. By the 1820’s, this revival had spread into the East. It helped to stimulate prison reform, temperance movement, women’s rights, and abolition. "
16, 3," Charles Grandison Finney","  Finney was the most famous preacher of the Second Great Awakening, credited by some with bringing half a million converts to the church. Finney was noted for expanding the role of women and allowing them to speak at prayer meetings and for urging his followers to support social reform movements including abolition, temperance, and education."
16, 4," Split in Methodist/Baptist Churches—1844-1845","  Both the Southern Methodist and Baptist churches split from their Northern counterparts over the issue of slavery."
16, 5," Split in Presbyterian Churches—1857","  The Northern and Southern Presbyterian churches split in 1857 also over the issue of slavery. The secession of the churches foreshadowed the secession of the South. First the churches split, then the political parties, followed by the Union."
16, 6," Burned-Over District  ","  This area near the Erie Canal in western New York was the scene of the most intense revival activity. It was populated by many descendants of the Puritans who flocked to hear hellfire sermons."
16, 7," Joseph Smith & Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints","  Smith started this new church in New York in 1830. The Mormons aroused antagonism by voting as a unit, drilling their militia openly for defensive purposes, and practicing polygamy. Joseph Smith and his brother were murdered by a mob in Carthage, Illinois, in 1844."
16, 8," Brigham Young & Mormon Migration—1846-1847","  Young took over the LDS Church after the murder of Joseph Smith. He proved to be an aggressive leader, an eloquent preacher, and a gifted administrator. To escape further persecution, Young led the Mormons over the plains to Utah."
16, 9," Horace Mann","  An educational reformer from Massachusetts, Mann argued for more and better schools, longer school years, higher pay for teachers, and an expanded curriculum in the emerging public education system."

16, 11," McGuffey Readers","  Teacher-preacher William H. McGuffey published McGuffey Readers in the 1830’s. He sold 122 million copies in the following decades. McGuffey Readers emphasized lessons of morality, patriotism, and idealism."
16, 12," Emma Willard & Troy Female Seminary","  An early supporter of women’s education, in 1818 she published A Plan for Improving Female Education, which became the basis for public education of women in New York.  In 1821, she opened her own girls’ school, the Troy Female Seminary, designed to prepare women for college."
16, 13," Oberlin College, Ohio","  Oberlin College, which had previously admitted blacks, in 1837 opened its doors to women as well. Oberlin, along with Mount Holyoke, provided the first opportunities for women to attend college."

16, 15," The Lyceum Movement","  Traveling lecturers helped to carry learning to the masses through the Lyceum Lecture Associations, which numbered 3,000 in 1835. Lyceums provided lectures on science, literature, and moral philosophy. This movement was in part responsible for the increase in the number of institutions of higher learning."
16, 16," Dorothea Dix & Treatment of the Insane","  A reformer and pioneer in the movement to treat the insane as mentally ill, she was responsible for improving conditions in jails, poorhouses and insane asylums throughout the US and Canada. She succeeded in persuading many states to assume responsibility for the humane care of the mentally ill.  Dix also helped to abolish imprisonment for debt."
16, 17," Neal S. Dow/Father of Prohibition—1851","  Dow sponsored the Maine Law of 1851. This law prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcohol. A dozen other states followed Maine’s example, but in most of these states, the laws didn’t even last a decade. They were repealed or declared unconstitutional.    "
16, 18," Suffragists/ Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, & Lucretia Mott","  Mott was a Quaker minister and the founder of the first female abolition society. Stanton, an ardent feminist who refused to include the word obey in her wedding vows, did much of the writing and planning for the women’s movement in the 1800’s. Anthony, originally a temperance worker, traveled and spoke widely and was the public face of the women’s movement. With Stanton she founded in 1869 the National Women’s Suffrage Association, which supported suffrage (the right to vote), birth control, and divorce. "
16, 19," Seneca Falls, NY, Women’s Rights Convention—1848","  Mott had been denied the right to participate at an international slavery conference in London. This helped inspire Mott and Stanton to organize the Seneca Falls Convention. The convention called for women’s rights. At Stanton’s insistence, the Declaration of Sentiments included a demand for the right to vote. This was so controversial that even Mott argued against it. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass supported Stanton, and the demand for suffrage was included."
16, 20," Utopian Communities  ","  New Harmony, Ind.: This was established in 1825 by Robert Owen, who hoped to abolish poverty and crime through cooperative labor and collective ownership of property.  Owen spoke out against the evils of religion, private property, and marriage founded on the concept of private property. The community made rapid progress in the areas of education and recreation, setting up the nation’s first kindergarten, free public school, and free library; and providing concerts, dances, lectures, and public discussions.  However, within two years, the community failed due to economic problems and the difficulty of uniting people who had not been trained for community living. Brook Farm, Mass.: Founded in 1841 by transcendentalists who hoped to bring together enlightened individuals in a community devoted to leading a simple and wholesome life, combining plain living with high thinking. Everyone pitched in to help with the farm work, and time was set aside for study and discussion. The experiment lasted until 1847 when it suffered economic collapse. Oneida, NY: Founded in 1848 by John Noyes, this community practiced complex marriage, birth control, and scientific selection of parents to produce superior children. Noyes preached perfectionism, the belief that it is possible to achieve a state of sinlessness for individuals and the perfection of society here on Earth. Financially stable because they produced excellent steel traps and silverware, Oneida lasted over thirty years until complaints about free love drove Noyes to Canada."
16, 21," National Identity Expressed in Art and Architecture","  The Hudson River School of Painting—Rather than following European styles in painting, artists including Thomas Cole and Asher Durant created images celebrating the beauty and grandeur of the American wilderness. This corresponded with the nationalistic upsurge after the War of 1812. Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson in his most famous address, ““The American Scholar,”“ called for American writers to break free of European traditions and develop a distinctive American perspective. In architecture, interest in British styles had waned during the War of 1812. Instead, Americans favored the Neoclassical style (also referred to as Greek Revival) that recalled the design of a Greek temple. In the mid-19th century, many Americans believed that ancient Greece represented the spirit of democracy. Public buildings, such as the US Capitol, were often in the Neoclassical style as architects sought to suggest the emphasis on reason, democracy, and the rule of law found in ancient Greece and Rome."
16, 22," John James Audubon","  Audubon was a naturalist best known for his The Birds of America, a massive work with paintings of every bird then known in the US. His concern about the destruction of wilderness helped to inspire the later environmental movement."
16, 23," Stephen Foster","  African-American minstrel music became very popular with the whites during the mid-19th century. The most popular tunes were written by a white man, Stephen Foster. "
16, 24," Washington Irving ","  The first American author to win international recognition as a literary figure, Irving wrote and published Knickerbocker’s History of New York in 1809 and The Sketch Book in 1819-1820."
16, 25," James Fenimore Cooper ","  Cooper was the first American novelist. His character Natty Bumppo spoke for wilderness and against the march of civilization in such books as The Last of the Mohicans (1826), The Pathfinder (1840), and The Deerslayer (1841)."
16, 26," American Transcendentalism","  Transcendentalism emphasized individualism, self-reliance, and self-discipline. Emphasizing morality over prosperity, transcendentalism was an important source of the reform movements of this time."
16, 27," Ralph Waldo Emerson","  The best known of the transcendentalists, Emerson lectured widely on the lyceum circuit. He was popular in part because his ideals reflected those of the individualistic republic."
16, 28," Henry David Thoreau","  Thoreau was a transcendentalist and non-conformist. He was arrested for refusing to pay taxes because he didn’t want to support a government that supported slavery.  Thoreau’s ““Essay on Civil Disobedience”“ exercised a strong influence on Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. "
16, 29," Walt Whitman","  Whitman’s great work Leaves of Grass, first published in 1855, was an answer to Emerson’s call for an American literature. Whitman broke from established poetical forms and subjects. His democratic vision celebrated every aspect of American life."
16, 30," Edgar Allan Poe","  Though he was a gifted stylist, Poe’s dark vision ran counter to the optimism of Whitman and much of American literature of his time. Some suggest this is the reason that he has been more popular in Europe than in America."
16, 31," Nathaniel Hawthorne","  Hawthorne’s work (The Scarlet Letter, The Marble Faun, The House of the Seven Gables) reflects the continuing focus on morality in American life. His work explores original sin, the eternal struggle between good and evil, and the weight of the dead hand of the past on the present."
16, 32," Herman Melville","  Melville was formerly a sailor, and his early tales of the sea were well liked. However, Moby Dick (a complex allegory of good and evil published in 1851) was not appreciated until much later. Key ID’s Ch. 17, 1793 – 1860 "
17, 1," King Cotton","  Southern leaders assumed that, in a conflict with the North, cotton would be the decisive factor. One fifth of Britain earned a living from the manufacture of cotton cloth. British textile mills got 75% of their cotton from the American South.  The assumption was that, in a war, the North would blockade Southern ports, forcing Britain into economic catastrophe. Britain would then use its navy to break the blockade, and the South would triumph."
17, 2," Proportion of Southerners who owned slaves","  Only 25% of Southerners owned any slaves. Families owning 100 or more slaves made up less than 1% of all slave owners. However, the poor, non-slaveholding whites supported slavery because they thought they could eventually buy a slave or two and move upward in accordance with the American dream. Also, they took comfort in knowing they outranked someone in Southern society, and they wanted to retain that racial superiority. "
17, 3," Racism in the North regarding the 250,000 freedmen","  Free blacks were rather unpopular in the North. Several states forbade them entrance, denied them the right to vote, and some barred blacks from public schools. The poor Irish hated the blacks, with whom they competed for menial jobs. There were also 250,000 free blacks living in the South. They were subject to various economic and legal restrictions similar to the later black codes."
17, 4," Absalom Jones and Richard Allen","  In 1786 Jones and Allen, free blacks, objected to the new segregation policy of their Philadelphia church. They led a walk-out of black parishioners. They set up new churches and became the first black Americans to be ordained ministers. Allen later founded a new denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church."
17, 5," Denmark Vesey","  Vesey was a former slave who had purchased his freedom. He and a group of followers planned a slave rebellion in Charleston in 1822. They intended to seize all the city’s weapons. Other slaves betrayed him; Vesey and at least thirty followers were publicly hanged."
17, 6," David Walker, An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World—1829 ","  Born a free black in North Carolina, Walker left the South and settled in Boston. In 1829 he published an anti-slavery pamphlet, Walker’s Appeal. Walker bitterly denounced slavery, those who profited by it, and those who willingly accepted it. Walker called for vengeance against whites, but he also expressed the hope that their cruel behavior toward blacks would change, making vengeance unnecessary. His message to the slaves was direct: if liberty is not given you, rise in bloody rebellion."
17, 7," Nat Turner’s Rebellion—1831","  Nat Turner, leading a group of sixty slaves who believed he was a divine instrument sent to free his people, killed almost sixty whites in South Hampton, Virginia. This led to a sensational manhunt in which 100 blacks were killed.  As a result, slave states strengthened measures against slaves and became more united in their support of fugitive slave laws. "
17, 8," The American Colonization Society/Liberia—1822","  The American Colonization Society was formed for the purpose of sending freed slaves back to Africa.  In 1822 the Republic of Liberia was established for this purpose. Some 15,000 freed blacks were transported there in the next four decades; however, most blacks had no desire to be transported to Africa after being partially Americanized."
17, 9," Theodore Dwight Weld & American Slavery As It Is —1839","  Weld was inspired by religious spirit of the Second Great Awakening. Expelled from Lane Seminary for organizing an eighteen-day debate on slavery, Weld preached anti-slavery gospel across the North. His pamphlet American Slavery as It Is was an inspiration for Uncle Tom’s Cabin. "
17, 10," William Lloyd Garrison & The Liberator —1831","  Garrison’s paper The Liberator gained national fame and notoriety due to his quotable and inflammatory language, attacking everyone from slave owners to moderate abolitionists.  Garrison believed that political action was powerless to abolish slavery since the Constitution protected slavery. In fact, he urged the North to secede from the Union. He sought to convert Southerners to his abolitionist views.  Garrison and other abolitionists were unpopular in the North; Garrison was almost lynched by a Northern mob in 1835. "
17, 11," Wendell Phillips & American Anti-Slavery Society—1833","  Phillips was a great antislavery orator who would not eat sugar or wear cotton because they were produced by slaves. He was a prominent member of the AA-SS."
17, 12," Sojourner Truth","  One of the best-known abolitionists of her day, she was the first black female orator to speak out against slavery. She was also an advocate for women’s rights."
17, 13," Frederick Douglass","  A self-educated slave who escaped in 1838, Douglass became the best-known abolitionist speaker. He edited an antislavery weekly, the North Star. He was also an early advocate for women’s rights. In opposition to Garrison, Douglass worked for political solutions to slavery, supporting the Liberty, Free Soil, and Republican parties."
17, 14," Gag Resolution in House of Representatives—1836","  In 1836 Southerners pushed through this resolution, which required all antislavery appeals to be tabled without debate. John Quincy Adams waged a successful eight-year fight for its repeal."
17, 15," Slavery as a Necessary Evil","  In the late 1700’s, slavery appeared to be declining. Fewer slaves were being imported to the US, and the price of slaves was dropping because the crops grown by slaves—tobacco, rice, and indigo—did not generate enough income to pay for their upkeep.  Jefferson and other slaveholders denounced slavery as a source of debt, economic stagnation, and moral dissipation. A French traveler reported that people throughout the South ““are constantly talking of abolishing slavery, of contriving some other means of cultivating their estates.”“  But the development of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793 made slave-cultivated cotton a profitable crop. In two years the price of slaves doubled; in a decade the number of slaves in the South increased by a third. However, many Southerners were ambivalent about slavery, referring to it as a necessary evil; they didn’t like it, but they felt it was economically necessary."
17, 16," Slavery as a Positive Good","  In 1837 Senator John Calhoun gave a speech in which he defended slavery, not as a necessary evil, but as a positive good. Said Calhoun, ““Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually.”“ In other words, slavery uplifted blacks by introducing them to civilization and Christianity. In addition, Southerners such as George Fitzhugh argued that slavery was the foundation of national prosperity, that slaves were actually treated better than were factory workers in the North, and that slavery was necessary for the continuance of the superior Southern culture that emphasized manners, graciousness, and honor in comparison to the money-grubbing society of the North."
17, 17," Reverend Elijah P. Lovejoy","  Lovejoy was an abolitionist and editor. His printing press was destroyed four times, and Lovejoy was killed defending it in 1837. His death was an example of violence against abolitionists.   Key ID’s Ch. 18, 1841-1848 	"
18, 1," The Aroostook War ","  In the early 1840’s, both Britain and Maine claimed the Aroostook River Valley under the peace treaty of 1783.  Britain wanted a road to run through the valley as a defensive precaution, and Maine wanted the timber. Lumberjacks from the two countries clashed, and eventually both sides called out local militias. "
18, 2," Battle of Maps & the Webster-Ashburton Treaty—1842","  The lumberjack dispute between Maine and the Canadian-British was settled by giving the British less land but the desired Halifax-Quebec route.   Despite the fact that the treaty gave each side a roughly equal piece of the disputed territory, citizens on both sides felt cheated. However, Webster had obtained an ancient map that indicated the British were entitled to the entire area in dispute. London officials found an old map that proved the Americans were entitled to the entire area in dispute. Both sides accepted the compromise as a result."
18, 3," The Election of 1844","  James Polk (Democrat) beat Henry Clay (Whig). Clay had tried to straddle the issue of annexing Texas while Polk was clearly in favor.   Out-going President Tyler took Polk’s victory as a mandate to annex Texas, and he signed the resolution three days before leaving office. Polk was the nation’s first dark-horse candidate elected president.  "
18, 4," Texas Annexation—1845","  Although the South favored annexing Texas, the North was opposed because they thought it would expand slavery, increase Southern representation in the House, and (if the Texas territory were split into several states) greatly boost Southern representation in the Senate. Texas was annexed by a joint resolution of Congress (which took only a simple majority in both houses) rather than by a treaty (which would have required a 2/3 vote in the Senate)."
18, 5," British Claims to the Oregon Country","  The British had strong claims to the Oregon country based on prior discovery and exploration, treaty rights, and actual occupation by British citizens. The British Hudson Bay Company traded profitably with the Indians for furs. "
18, 6," American Claims to the Oregon Country","  America also had claims based on exploration (Gray and the Columbia River, Lewis and Clark’s expedition) and occupation (activities of Astor’s American Fur Company, arrival of 5000 Americans by 1845, many inspired by the reports of missionary Marcus Whitman).  American and British pioneers continued to live side by side through all this but America gained the advantage of population with influx of US settlers to the West in 1840’s."
18, 7," Manifest Destiny","  This was the belief that the US was destined to spread to the Pacific, perhaps over the entire continent. Motivations for Manifest Destiny included the following: 1) hunger for land, 2) fear that the British would gain control of the western part of North America, 3) the need for Pacific ports to facilitate trade with Asia, 4) the belief that expansion would allow the spread of democracy, 5) the desire to expand American power, and 6) the desire for new markets for American products."
18, 8," 54°40’ or Fight!","  In part to calm Northern fears about expansion into Texas, the Democrats during Polk’s 1844 campaign proposed acquiring all of the Oregon Territory up to the boundary with Russian Alaska (54°40’). Polk knew that it would take a war with Britain to obtain all of Oregon. He hoped to use the threat of war to persuade Britain to accept the compromise they had rejected in the past, the 49th parallel (the current boundary). In 1846 the 49th parallel was agreed to as the northern boundary."
18, 9," President Polk—the most successful president in history?","  Polk was successful in achieving his four main goals: lower the tariff (from 32% to 25%), restore the independent treasury system, acquire California, and settle the Oregon dispute."
18, 10," Settlement of the Oregon Country","  Missionaries such as Jason Lee and Marcus Whitman came to Oregon in the 1830’s and 1840’s, sending back to the US glowing reports of the prospects for settlement. Between 1840 and 1848, 11,500 settlers came to Oregon on the Oregon Trail, solidifying the American claim to the territory."
18, 11," John Slidell’s Mission to Mexico","  Polk sent Slidell to Mexico in 1845 to purchase California. He was instructed to offer a maximum of $25 million for California and the area east of it. The Mexican people refused to hear Slidell’s insulting proposition. Mexico was still upset about the loss of Texas."
18, 12," Polk’s War Message","  Polk proposed to his cabinet a declaration of war based on Mexico’s unpaid claims to Americans and on the rejection of Slidell. The cabinet urged that such a declaration be postponed until Mexico started shooting. Polk had already sent General Taylor to the Rio Grande (into territory Mexico claimed). When Mexican troops crossed the Rio Grande and attacked Taylor, Polk sent a war message to Congress asking for a declaration of war since Mexico had shed ““American blood on American soil.”“"
18, 13," Lincoln’s Spot Resolutions","  Lincoln, a Whig congressman, introduced several resolutions demanding to know the precise spot on American soil where American blood was shed. Polk’s opponents in Congress were pointing out that the battle took place on land that no previous president had claimed as American soil."
18, 14," John C. Frémont & California Bear Flag Republic","  Frémont had been sent to California in 1845 to ““watch over American interests.”“ He interpreted his instructions liberally, and with a small, armed group, seized Sonoma and proclaimed the independent Bear Flag Republic in June 1846.  "
18, 15," Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott in Mexico","  Taylor (Old Rough and Ready) led American forces to several victories in northern Mexico. In February 1847, he defeated Santa Anna at Buena Vista. His successes made him a presidential contender. Scott (Old Fuss and Feathers) captured Vera Cruz and Mexico City in what was widely seen as a brilliant campaign despite a shortage of troops, disease, and a lack of political support. Scott’s victory in Mexico City essentially ended the war."
18, 16," Nicholas P. Trist & the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo","  Trist and Scott arranged an armistice (a halt in the fighting), but Santa Anna used the time to strengthen his defenses. Polk, unhappy with Trist, recalled him. Trist wrote back, refusing to return. Before Polk could act further, Trist concluded the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The treaty 1) confirmed the US title to Texas, 2) set the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas, 3) gave the US the land between Texas and the Pacific in exchange for $15 million, and 4) committed the US to pay the $3.25 million in claims owed to US citizens by Mexico."
18, 17," Wilmot Proviso—1846","  At the start of the Mexican War, Representative David Wilmot introduced a bill to block slavery from any territory the US might win from Mexico. Wilmot and many other Northern Democrats had supported the annexation of Texas on the assumption that Texas would be the last slave state.  The measure passed in the House but failed in the Senate.  Key ID’s Ch. 19, 1848-1854 "
19, 1," Popular Sovereignty","  Introduced by Lewis Cass, Democratic candidate in 1848, the popular sovereignty doctrine stated that the people of a territory should determine the status of slavery themselves. It had a widespread appeal. The public liked it because it followed the democratic tradition of self-determination. Politicians liked it because it seemed a reasonable compromise between a ban on slavery and Southern demands to protect slavery."
19, 2," Free Soil Party—1848","  Northern antislavery forces were unhappy with the choices of Cass and popular sovereignty or Whig Zachary Taylor, a slaveholder. They formed the Free Soil Party, favoring the Wilmot Proviso and a homestead act that would give small farms to those who wished to settle on public lands. Components of the party included antislavery Northern Democrats, Conscience Whigs, members of the Liberty Party, and eastern workers who wanted a homestead act. The Free Soilers argued that slavery undermined the dignity of labor and limited social mobility. Viewing slavery as an economically inefficient, obsolete institution, they believed that slavery should be contained, and that if contained, it would ultimately disappear."
19, 3," Conscience Whigs","  These were Whigs who condemned slavery on moral grounds. They were based in New England; most later joined the new Republican Party."
19, 4," Cotton Whigs","  These were Whigs who favored slavery and who eventually joined the Democrats."
19, 5," The Underground Railroad","  The Underground Railroad was an organized group of abolitionists who used their homes as ““stations”“ and helped to guide slaves from the South to freedom. By 1850 1,000 slaves (out of four million) were running away each year. However, more gained their freedom by self-purchase or voluntary emancipation than by escape."
19, 6," Harriet Tubman","  A runaway slave and so-called conductor on the Underground Railroad, in nineteen trips to the South she rescued over 300 slaves. "
19, 7," California and the 49ers ","  Gold was discovered in California in 1848. In 1849 there was a huge rush of 100,000 gold seekers to the territory.  Californians, encouraged by President Taylor, bypassed the territory stage, drafted a constitution that barred slavery, and applied for statehood. Predictably, the North and South disagreed about the status of slavery in California. "
19, 8," The Compromise of 1850","  The Compromise of 1850 was the work of Henry Clay. He was supported by Stephen Douglas and Daniel Webster. California had petitioned for admission as a free state; this would upset the sectional balance in the Senate. Southern states threatened secession. The nation faced a real possibility of war. The Compromise called for admitting California as a free state, organizing Utah and New Mexico as territories on the basis of popular sovereignty, adjusting the Texas/New Mexico border (which created a larger area likely to be free soil), transferring responsibility for Texas’ public debt to the national government, abolishing the slave trade (not slavery) in the District of Columbia, establishing a tougher fugitive slave law, and Congress passing a resolution denying its jurisdiction over interstate slave trade."
19, 9," Daniel Webster’s 7th of March Speech","  In a famous speech, Webster pleaded with the North to accept the Compromise. Webster argued that it was not necessary to restrict slavery from the Mexican Cession because the area, he believed, was geographically unsuited to cotton farming and slavery. Although abolitionists branded Webster a traitor, his speech helped the Compromise win acceptance."
19, 10," Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 (the Bloodhound Bill)","  This was one of the provisions of the Compromise of 1850. It decreed that fleeing slaves could not testify on their own behalf and that they were denied a trial by jury. The federal commissioners who handled the cases received $5 if a slave was declared free and $10 if the slave was found to be a runaway. Northerners who aided the slaves in their escape were subject to heavy fines and jail sentences. Further, this law allowed slave catchers to capture slaves who had reached the North decades earlier. Though this law was no better enforced than its predecessors, it helped to unite the North against slavery."
19, 11," The Death of Taylor/President Millard Fillmore","  Taylor would have vetoed any compromise. His death allowed Vice President Millard Fillmore to become president; Fillmore signed the Compromise of 1850. "
19, 12," Personal Liberty Laws","  Enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused passions in the North. The capture of one escaped slave in Boston led to a protest by 50,000. Nine Northern states passed personal liberty laws to block state officials from enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law."
19, 13," How Did the Compromise of 1850 Help Win the Coming Civil War for the North?","  The Compromise did not prevent the Civil War; it merely delayed it for a decade. However, that decade helped to unify the North and gave the North time to increase its advantages in population, manufacturing, and transportation. Had the war begun in 1850, the South might have seceded successfully."
19, 14," The Election of 1852","  Democrats endorsed the Compromise of 1850 and popular sovereignty, and won the election with dark horse Franklin Pierce, a pro-South Northerner. The Whigs nominated Winfield Scott. Northern Whigs accepted Scott but abhorred his platform, which endorsed the Fugitive Slave Law. Southern Whigs accepted the platform but rejected Scott whom they mistrusted on slavery issues. This election marked the end of the Whigs as an effective political force. It also marked the decline of national political parties and the rise of sectional parties.  Pierce was the last presidential candidate for eighty years to win both the popular and electoral vote in both the North and South."
19, 15," William Walker & Nicaragua—1856 ","  Having failed in his earlier efforts to seize Baja California and turn it into a slave state, Walker gained control of Nicaragua with a private army of Southerners. He set himself up as president and legalized slavery. Walker was overthrown by a coalition of Central American nations in 1860."
19, 16," Clayton-Bulwer Treaty—1850","  Britain feared the US would monopolize trade routes across Central America and so established itself at Greytown on the eastern end of a possible Nicaraguan canal route. This was a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine. The potential conflict was averted by the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, which provided that neither America nor Britain would fortify or secure exclusive control of any isthmian waterway. "
19, 17," Commodore Matthew C. Perry/Japan—1853–1854","  Perry arrived in Japan, which had been closed to outsiders for nearly two hundred years, and, using a combination of force and tact, persuaded the Japanese to sign a treaty in 1854 that allowed America to get a commercial foot in the door. "
19, 18," Ostend Manifesto—1854","  Manifest Destiny and the desire for more slave territory led the South to covet Cuba. It could potentially be divided into several slave states, restoring the sectional balance in the Senate. Several filibustering expeditions (essentially attacks by pirates) attempted to take Cuba by force in the early 1850’s. In Ostend, Belgium, the American ambassadors to Spain, England, and France drew up a top-secret dispatch, known as the Ostend Manifesto. This dispatch urged the US to offer $120 million to Spain for Cuba. If Spain refused and their ownership endangered American interests, the document stated, the United States would be justified in wresting the island from the Spanish. The North was predictably angered by the proposal, and Pierce disavowed the Manifesto. "
19, 19," Gadsden Purchase—1853","  Five years after the Mexican Cession, the United States paid Mexico $10 million for a small strip of land in Southern Arizona and New Mexico. This land provided a favorable southern railroad route into California. Many Americans felt that the large sum paid for this territory was just ““conscience money.”“  "
19, 20," Stephen A. Douglas & Kansas-Nebraska Act—1854","  Douglas hoped to have a transcontinental railroad built, not on the southern route through the Gadsden Purchase, but from Chicago to the West Coast. (He owned considerable Chicago real estate.) Opponents of this route objected that it would have to cross unorganized territories. Douglas also hoped to win Southern support for his presidential bid, so he proposed repealing the Missouri Compromise of 1820 (which, Douglas argued, was outdated as a result of the Compromise of 1850). The bill proposed to organize the territories of Kansas and Nebraska on the basis of popular sovereignty.  In consequence, both pro- and antislavery forces rushed to Kansas, hoping to influence any vote on slavery. As a result, a small-scale civil war known as ““Bleeding Kansas”“ erupted."
19, 21," Republican Party—1854","  The North protested the Kansas-Nebraska Act vehemently. The Republican Party was organized to oppose expansion of slavery. The party was composed of Free Soilers, anti-Douglas Democrats, and Conscience Whigs. It was purely a sectional party with no support in the South. Its appeal was so powerful that after only two years it almost elected a president and it completely displaced the Whigs, who disappeared by 1856. Key ID’s Ch. 20, 1854-1861 "
20, 1," Impact of Uncle Tom’s Cabin","  This melodramatic novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe helped to solidify Northern opposition to slavery and bring on the Civil War. Many Northerners who read it vowed not to obey the Fugitive Slave Act. The book also aroused public opinion in England and France in support of the North."
20, 2," Bleeding Kansas","  Popular sovereignty was to determine the status of slavery in Kansas. It did not work well since both abolitionists and pro-slavery men (those from Missouri were known as border ruffians) poured into the state to influence the vote. Each side established a government of questionable legality. Both sides used violence in their attempts to determine the outcome. Over 200 people were killed in a miniature civil war that lasted until it was overtaken by the national conflict in 1861."
20, 3," John Brown at Pottawatomie Creek","  Brown was one of the abolitionists who had moved to Kansas to influence the vote. In response to a border ruffian raid on Lawrence, Kansas, (the raid destroyed two Free-Soil printing presses but killed no one), Brown led a band of his followers to Pottawatomie Creek in May of 1856. There they hacked to pieces five pro-slavery men. This act brought vicious retaliation from those in favor of slavery, and the violence of Bleeding Kansas was ignited."
20, 4," Emigrant Aid Societies","  Abolitionist groups such as the New England Emigrant Aid Society sent to Kansas settlers armed with Sharps rifles (Beecher’s Bibles—named for abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher who said that guns would do more than Bibles to enforce morality in Kansas). The movement encouraged 2600 people to move to Kansas."
20, 5," Lecompton Constitution","  In 1857 the pro-slavery forces in Kansas applied for statehood and drew up the Lecompton Constitution. This document would protect the rights of slaveholders already in Kansas, allowing them to retain their slave property. The referendum on the Lecompton Constitution permitted two choices: a pro-slavery constitution permitting the importation of more slaves or a pro-slavery constitution that banned the import of more slaves. Free-Soilers boycotted this election.   President Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, but Senator Douglas opposed it. Another vote was taken, this one allowing Kansans to choose between accepting the Lecompton Constitution and slavery or rejecting it (and delaying statehood). The voters overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution."
20, 6," Election of 1856","  The Democratic Party, seeking to evade the slavery issue, nominated James Buchanan, a Northerner with Southern sympathies (a doughface), and endorsed popular sovereignty in their platform. The Republicans nominated John C. Frémont, an opponent of slavery, and wrote a platform opposing the extension of slavery into the territories. The American or Know-Nothing Party nominated ex-president Fillmore. The Whig Party had disintegrated at this point. Frémont carried eleven Northern states, but Buchanan won five other Northern states as well as the South, seizing the White House. At this point, Democrats were attempting to placate slave states, but Southern leaders were talking openly of secession should a ““Black Republican”“ win the election."
20, 7," James Buchanan/Doughface President","  When the states started to secede, Buchanan said this was illegal but he couldn’t do anything about it because the Constitution did not allow the federal government to use force against the states. A doughface was a northerner who was sympathetic to southern views. There are several explanations for the term, the most likely being that such northerners were pliable, like dough."
20, 8," Sumner/Brooks Affair—1856 ","  Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, a leading abolitionist, gave a speech in which he referred insultingly to South Carolina and her Senator Butler. Representative Preston Brooks, also from South Carolina, resented the insults to his state and his senator. Brooks attacked Sumner at his Senate desk and proceeded to beat Sumner with a cane. Sumner fell to the floor unconscious and bleeding. Sumner’s injuries were serious, and he was forced to leave his Senate seat for three years. Brooks became a hero in the South; supporters sent him new canes. "
20, 9," Dred Scott Case & Roger B. Taney—1857","  Scott, a Missouri slave, sued for his freedom, claiming that his five-year stay in the northern portion of the Louisiana Territory made free land by the Missouri Compromise had made him a free man.  Chief Justice Taney’s decision stated that Scott couldn’t sue in federal court because he was property; blacks, said Taney, could not be citizens. Further, Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional since it deprived slave owners of the right to take their property into federal territories in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In essence, this meant that all territories had to be open to slavery. "
20, 10," Lincoln/Douglas Debates—1858","  Douglas, a Democrat, was running for re-election to the Senate from Illinois against Lincoln, a relatively unknown Republican. They engaged in a series of seven debates, the most famous being in Freeport, Illinois. Though Douglas won the election, these debates made Lincoln known throughout the North.  Lincoln opposed the extension of slavery into the territories, but he argued against social and political equality for blacks. He also stated that Congress could not abolish slavery in the South.  Douglas also opposed the extension of slavery into the territories, but argued that popular sovereignty was the best means of accomplishing this without disrupting the Union."
20, 11," Freeport Doctrine—1858","  In Freeport, Illinois, Lincoln asked Douglas to state his view on slavery in the territories. Douglas replied that the Dred Scott decision made slavery legal in the territories in theory, but the people of a territory could keep slaves out in practice. They could do this simply by refusing to enact the laws necessary for slavery to function. Douglas was narrowly reelected to the Senate, but his Freeport Doctrine cost him Southern support for the presidency in 1860. "
20, 12," John Brown’s Raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia—1859","  Hoping to spark a slave rebellion, Brown and a small group of followers attacked the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. The attack failed and Brown was hanged for treason. Northerners applauded Brown’s devotion to the cause of freedom. Southerners saw the raid as evidence of the North’s unstinting efforts to abolish slavery."
20, 13," Election of 1860","  Lincoln, nominated by the Republican Party, won the election. The Republicans opposed the expansion of slavery to the territories but promised not to interfere with slavery in the states. Their platform also pledged a protective tariff, federal aid for internal improvements, a transcontinental railroad, and free homestead farms. Northern Democrats supported popular sovereignty and nominated Douglas. Southern Democrats demanded the enforcement of the Dred Scott decision and nominated John Breckinridge. The Constitutional Union Party (mostly former Whigs and Know-Nothings) nominated John Bell, called for support of the Union, and hoped for compromise. Lincoln, though he won only 40% of the popular vote and was not on the ballot in the South, swept the North and won the election. His election convinced the South that it was time to act.  "
20, 14," Crittenden Proposal—1860","  This was a last-minute attempt at a compromise to save the Union. James Crittenden of Kentucky proposed a series of constitutional amendments: 1) Slavery in the territories would be prohibited above 3630’ (the old Missouri Compromise line) and allowed below it. 2) The federal government would be forbidden to interfere with slavery in the South. 3) New states could enter the Union free or slave as they chose. 4) Owners of runaway slaves would be compensated. 5) Personal liberty laws would be repealed. Lincoln rejected the Crittenden proposal, and it collapsed. "
20, 15," The Confederate States of America /7 States, Initially","  South Carolina seceded in December of 1860, followed by Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas, and Tennessee followed after Fort Sumter. A number of factors led to secession. The Southern states saw the political balance in Congress tipping against them. They were appalled by the triumph of the Republican Party (opposed to slavery in the territories; in favor of a high protective tariff, federal financing of internal improvements, and a homestead act). They were tired of Northern interference with slavery (Underground Railroad, Brown’s raid, abolitionist propaganda). Many felt that the North would not fight secession. And they felt they had a constitutional right to secede. 	 Key ID’s Ch. 21, 1861-1865 "
21, 1," Lincoln’s 1st Inaugural Address—March 1861","  Lincoln promised not to interfere with slavery where it already existed and to enforce federal laws including the Fugitive Slave Law. He pledged to the South that there would be no conflict unless the South provoked it.  But he also labeled secession illegal and promised to hold on to federal property in the states that had seceded, e.g., Fort Sumter."
21, 2," Fort Sumter—April 1861","  When South Carolina seceded from the Union, it demanded that all federal property in the state be surrendered to state authorities. When Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861, Sumter was one of only two forts in the South still under Union control. Learning that Lincoln planned to send supplies to the fort, Confederate General Beauregard demanded Major Robert Anderson’s surrender, which was refused. On April 12, 1861, the Confederate Army began bombarding the fort, which surrendered on April 14, 1861.  The attack solidified public opinion in the North in favor of the use of force against the South. The next day Lincoln declared that an insurrection existed and called for 75,000 three-month volunteers."
21, 3," Border States, esp. Kentucky","  Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware were slave states that did not secede. Had the North fired first, they likely would have seceded. The Border States would have vastly increased the Southern population and industrial capacity had they seceded. Kentucky was geographically important because it provided access to the Ohio River and its tributaries that flowed deep into CSA territory."
21, 4," Southern Advantages in 1861","  The South could fight defensively behind interior lines. The South was fighting on its own soil for self-preservation (which boosted morale). The South had the most talented officers. Southerners were more accustomed to the outdoor life of riding and hunting and so made an easier transition to the military life. The South would not have to win to gain independence. Simply fighting the Union to a stalemate would have secured Southern independence. "
21, 5," Northern Advantages in 1861","  The North had a stronger economy than did the South (the North possessed three times the wealth of the South). The North had a superior navy allowing it to blockade the South and continue foreign trade. The North had more railroads, three times what had been built in the South. The North had more manpower (22 million in comparison to the South’s 9 million—3 ½ million of whom were slaves). This advantage increased even more during the war due to immigration. The North had more factories to produce supplies (90% of the nation’s industry). The North had superior civilian political leaders. "
21, 6," Failure of King Cotton","  The South assumed that British demand for cotton to supply its mills would force England to support the South. Further, the aristocratic British elite favored the less-democratic South.  But the British working class favored the North because of the slavery issue. Further, the British had on hand large surpluses of cotton that initially kept the mills running and the British working class employed. The Union captured supplies of cotton and sent them to England while the South also exported what cotton it could through the Union blockade. And the increased price for raw cotton encouraged Egypt and India to increase production. Finally, the British suffered poor harvests during the war years and needed Northern corn and wheat more than Southern cotton."
21, 7," The Trent Affair—1861","  A Union warship stopped the Trent, a British ship, and removed two Confederate diplomats. Britain was outraged at this violation of neutral rights and sent troops to Canada. Lincoln released the prisoners; ““One war at a time,”“ he said."
21, 8," The Alabama","  The Alabama was one of several British-made warships that fought for the Confederacy, destroying over sixty Northern ships in twenty-two months before it was sunk in 1864. US Ambassador to England, Charles Francis Adams, eventually convinced the British that it was not in their long-term interests to violate their status as a neutral nation by building ships for the South. "
21, 9," Laird Rams—1863","  These were two Confederate warships built in Britain at the Laird shipyard. They were equipped with iron rams for sinking ships and with heavy guns. They could have broken the Union blockade and threatened Northern cities.  Ambassador Adams convinced England that the sale of the rams to the South would mean war against England, so England bought them for the Royal Navy."
21, 10," Maximilian in Mexico—1863-1867","  Seeking to take advantage of the American conflict, the French sent an army to Mexico City and then sent Austrian Archduke Maximilian to rule Mexico as France’s puppet. The US protested but was not able to deal with the problem until after the Civil War. At that point, the US threatened an invasion of Mexico to remove Maximilian. The French withdrew their troops; Maximilian was captured and executed by the Mexicans. This event was significant in demonstrating US resolve and ability to enforce the Monroe Doctrine."
21, 11," Difficulties Governing the CSA","  The Confederacy was established on the principle of states’ rights. This made it difficult for President Jefferson Davis to rule effectively. For example, some states were reluctant to allow their troops to serve outside their state borders. In addition, Davis lacked the political skill needed to persuade people to do difficult things they did not want to do. He tended to order people rather than persuade them. At times the CSA congress talked of impeaching him."
21, 12," Lincoln Stretching the Constitution","  Lincoln at times exceeded his constitutional powers in prosecuting the war. His position was that had he not done so, it might have been impossible to save the Union. His actions included the following: increasing the size of the army without congressional approval, authorizing government expenditures without congressional approval, suspending the writ of habeas corpus, ordering civilians to be tried in military courts, and supervising voting in the Border States."
21, 13," The Draft—1862 & 1863","  The South initially relied on volunteers. By 1862 they found it necessary to institute a draft of men seventeen to fifty. The wealthy could hire a substitute or purchase an exemption. Slave owners or overseers with more than twenty slaves to supervise were exempt. Southerners protested that it had become ““a rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight.”“  The North likewise relied on volunteers initially, then on cash bounties to enlistees. A draft became necessary in 1863, and, as in the South, the wealthy could buy their way out. In New York City in 1863, poor, antiblack Irish rioted against the draft leading to at least seventy-three deaths. "
21, 14," The National Banking Act—1863","  This established the first national banking system since the demise of the BUS. It allowed banks to obtain national charters, buy government bonds, and issue sound paper money backed by those bonds. This helped finance the Union war effort through the sale of government bonds. It also helped the North establish sound currency and avoid the 9,000% inflation the South suffered during the war. "
21, 15," Homestead Act—1862","  With the South out of Congress for the duration of the war, Republicans dominated Washington. Without Democratic opposition, they enacted a number of their campaign promises: a transcontinental railroad, the Morrill Land Grant Act (which funded state land grant universities), and the Homestead Act. The Homestead Act gave 160 acres of public land to settlers who lived on the land for five years."
21, 16," Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell & Clara Barton","  Blackwell organized the US Sanitary Commission which provided medical supplies and assistance to armies; many women worked with her, which gave women confidence and organizational skills they used to further the women’s movement after the war. Barton transformed nursing from a lowly service to a respected profession and opened up an area for employment outside the home for women after the war. In 1881 she founded the American Red Cross.   Key ID’s Ch. 22, 1861-1865 "
22, 1," First Battle of Bull Run—July 1861","  Union troops advancing on the Confederate capital of Richmond were defeated. This was the first major battle of the Civil War; both sides were ill prepared. Prior to Bull Run, both sides predicted a quick war; Lincoln assumed the war would be over in ninety days. Bull Run showed that this would not be the case. The North responded to the defeat with renewed determination. The victory caused the South to be overconfident; enlistments dropped and preparations for war slackened. "
22, 2," Thomas ““Stonewall”“ Jackson","  One of the South’s best generals, Jackson was, in Lee’s words, ““my right arm.”“ Jackson won his nickname at Bull Run when his troops stood firm like a stone wall against the Yankees."
22, 3," George B. McClellan","  Given command of the Union forces after Bull Run, McClellan excelled at transforming raw recruits into a professional army. He was reluctant to attack the South, however, always assuming incorrectly that Lee had superior forces."
22, 4," Ironclads: Merrimack & Monitor","  The South restored a former US warship (Merrimack) and plated its sides with old iron railroad rails. It was renamed the Virginia; not a seaworthy craft but it did destroy wooden ships of the North and threatened the whole Northern fleet. The Union built a tiny ironclad, the Monitor, which held off the Merrimack. This was the first real testing of ironclads and foreshadowed the doom of wooden warships. "
22, 5," Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg)—September 1862","  A draw on the battlefield, this bloodiest day of the war was a strategic victory for the North as it halted Lee’s invasion of the North. But it was more important for two other reasons. It provided Lincoln with the military success he needed to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. France and Britain were close to intervening diplomatically but decided not to after this battle."
22, 6," Emancipation Proclamation—January 1863","  The Emancipation Proclamation declared free the slaves in rebel Confederate states but did not mention the Border States. Thousands of slaves from Southern plantations flocked to Union armies, weakening the Southern war effort.  Some felt, however, that Lincoln had unfairly changed the goal of the war, and many soldiers deserted. But for the most part, this bolstered the moral cause at home and abroad and thus strengthened the North’s position."
22, 7," Black Union Soldiers","  At the start of the war, the Union forces barred blacks from enlisting (even though blacks had served in the Revolution and the War of 1812). Lincoln feared that enlisting blacks would push Border States such as Missouri over to the Confederacy.  After Emancipation (and as manpower ran low), blacks were allowed to serve—180,000 in the Union forces, about 10% of the total Union enlistments. In 1864, faced with a shortage of soldiers, the South considered impressing its slaves into the military in exchange for freedom at the end of the war."
22, 8," ““Remember Fort Pillow”“","  Black Union soldiers captured by the South were not treated as prisoners of war until 1864. Many were put to death as slaves in revolt. The massacre of black soldiers after their surrender at Fort Pillow was an infamous case that inspired black troops."
22, 9," Battle of Gettysburg—July 1863","  Lee invaded the North in hopes of encouraging Northerners to press for peace and Europeans to intervene. Gettysburg was the northernmost point of the Southern advance.  The Union victory was the turning point of the war. After Gettysburg, the South had no real chance at victory, though they fought for two more years. "
22, 10," Gettysburg Address—November 1863","  Lincoln delivered this 273-word speech at the dedication of a national cemetery in Gettysburg. In this two-minute address Lincoln said that the point of the Civil War was not simply to preserve the Union but to preserve democracy (““government of the people, by the people, for the people”“) and the ideals of the Declaration (““dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal”“)."
22, 11," Ulysses S. Grant","  Grant was little known until his triumph in Tennessee when he captured Ft. Henry and Ft. Donelson, cementing Kentucky to the Union and opening the gateway to the Union invasion of Tennessee and Georgia. Grant was criticized as a butcher for suffering tremendous losses in battle. But the Union could replace its lost soldiers; the South could not. Grant eventually ground down the Confederate forces. After his victory at Vicksburg, Grant was given command of all Union forces in 1864."
22, 12," Fall of Vicksburg—July 1863","  Grant led the North to victory in the siege of Vicksburg, giving the Union control of the Mississippi. Grant’s victory combined with the win at Gettysburg the same week to quiet Northern peace agitators. It also persuaded the British to stop delivery of the Laird rams and the French to halt the sale of six warships to the South."
22, 13," William Tecumseh Sherman & Fall of Atlanta—September 1864","  Sherman’s forces captured Atlanta and then headed for Savannah on the coast. The victory in Atlanta was a significant boost for Lincoln’s sagging reelection campaign."
22, 14," Concept of Total War/”“War is Hell”“","  Earlier wars had largely pitted two armies against each other. General Sherman’s total war concept destroyed farms, factories, and rail lines in his march through Georgia to the sea. The purpose was to eliminate anything that could help to supply the Confederate army and to weaken the Confederate soldiers’ morale by making them worry about the conditions for their families back home. "
22, 15," Copperheads","  These were extreme Northern peace Democrats, named for the poisonous snake. They attacked the draft and denounced Lincoln and emancipation. They were especially strong in southern Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. Representative Clement Vallandigham was the most famous Copperhead. Demanding an end to the war, he was charged with sedition, tried by a military tribunal, and banished to the Confederacy. "
22, 16," Election of 1864","  Lincoln first faced a battle just to win re-nomination by his own party. He was condemned for not having won the war and for being too willing to compromise. Hoping to win the votes of war Democrats, the Republicans labeled themselves the Union party and nominated Democrat Andrew Johnson from the Border State of Tennessee as vice president. Peace Democrats nominated the deposed Union commander George McClellan. McClellan repudiated the peace platform, but still managed to win 45% of the vote. Lincoln pulled out a win, aided by Northern victories and by questionable voting practices in the Border States and among Union troops."
22, 17," Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House—April 1865","  Grant finally cornered Lee’s worn and hungry army and gave generous terms to the South; when Northern soldiers cheered the surrender, Grant admonished them saying, ““The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again.”“ Lee resisted calls by some to continue a guerilla campaign against the North that could have extended the war for years. "
22, 18," John Wilkes Booth","  Five days after Appomattox, Booth shot Lincoln at Ford’s Theater in Washington. The assassination at the moment of victory solidified Lincoln’s reputation in the North. Southerners came to see the assassination as a disaster for them as Lincoln favored a moderate policy on Reconstruction."
22, 19," Results of the Civil War","  Over 600,000 soldiers (North and South) died as a result of battle or illness. Several hundred thousand more were seriously wounded.   Slavery was abolished. Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation had a limited effect, the Thirteenth Amendment eliminated slavery throughout the country. Politically, the war settled the conflict over states’ rights. Nullification and secession were no longer viable political actions. Those who favored a strong central government triumphed. The power of the national government increased dramatically as a result of the Civil War. Executive power expanded. Lincoln, the first strong president since Jackson, showed the possibilities of using executive power to deal with crises. The Republican Party became the dominant party until the New Deal. Industrialization accelerated in the North. And with this came immense wealth for some and a materialistic attitude that characterized the Gilded Age.    Key ID’s Ch. 23, 1865-1877 "
23, 1," Lincoln’s Second Inaugural—March 1865 ","  Lincoln offered the South an opportunity to move ahead with the North without severe punishment:““With malice toward none, with charity for all”“"
23, 2," The Freedmen’s Bureau—1865","  This was intended to be a social welfare agency providing food, clothing, medical care, and education to both freedmen and poor whites. The Bureau established 4,000 schools in the South. Its greatest success was in teaching 200,000 freedmen how to read. Its greatest failure had to do with land distribution. Although the Bureau was authorized to distribute land confiscated from Confederates, little of this was done."
23, 3," General Oliver O. Howard","  Howard was the head of the Freedmen’s Bureau and a friend of African Americans. He later helped to desegregate his Washington, D.C., church and to found an all-black college (later named Howard University in his honor)."
23, 4," President Andrew Johnson—Background & Personality","  Johnson was born into a poor family and then orphaned. He never attended school, but his wife taught him to write. He was a champion of poor whites against Southern aristocrats (although at one point Johnson owned eight slaves).  He refused to secede with his own state of Tennessee at the start of the Civil War; Lincoln’s Union Party needed to gain support from Democrats and so chose Johnson as the vice presidential candidate. Johnson was hotheaded, contentious, and stubborn. Throughout his presidency Congress kept overriding his vetoes, basically governing over his head."
23, 5," Lincoln’s 10% Plan for Reconstruction—1863 ","  Lincoln favored a mild Reconstruction to heal the wounds of the war as quickly as possible.  He recommended that since Southern states had never legally withdrawn from the Union, they could form state governments and send representatives and senators to Congress when at least 10% of those who had voted in 1860 swore allegiance to the Union and accepted emancipation. All but a few Confederate leaders were to be pardoned. Radical Republicans in Congress thought Lincoln’s plan was not harsh enough. They feared that the planter aristocracy and enslavement of blacks would be restored."
23, 6," Congress’s Wade-Davis Plan for Reconstruction—1864 ","  This bill required 50% of the voters in each state to swear that they had never supported the Confederacy (not likely) and to swear allegiance to the Union. This bill would have also imposed military governors on each Southern state. Lincoln vetoed the Wade-Davis bill. In retaliation, Congress refused to seat representatives from Louisiana, which had followed Lincoln’s 10% plan."
23, 7," ““State Suicide”“ and ““Conquered Province”“ Theories","  Senator Charles Sumner, Radical Republican leader in the Senate, advocated the state suicide theory. He said that when the Southern states rebelled, they committed suicide as states and reverted to the status of territories, becoming subject to federal supervision. Congress has the power to determine when a territory may be admitted to the Union. Representative Thaddeus Stevens, Radical Republican leader in the House, supported the conquered province theory. The South, he said, had left the Union; the North had defeated it in war and now ruled the South like a conquered nation. The North could do anything it wished with the South, even rule it permanently as a colony. "
23, 8,"  Black Codes","  In order to keep the freedmen in economically and socially subordinate positions and to secure an inexpensive source of labor, many Southern states passed Black Codes. The first was enacted by Mississippi in 1865.  Congressional Republicans protested that these returned blacks to a condition little better than slavery. The Black Codes were in effect for only a few years. Congressional action to pass civil rights legislation guaranteeing the rights of the freedmen (the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, the 14th Amendment) effectively nullified the codes. Carpetbag governments in many states repealed the Black Codes."
23, 9," Sharecropping","  This is an economic arrangement under which a landless person contracts with a landowner to work a piece of land. The landowner advances the sharecropper money for food, seed, fertilizer, etc. In return, the landowner receives a share of the crop, usually 50%. Both blacks and poor whites often ended up as sharecroppers, often tied to the land for generations by accumulated debts."
23, 10," Civil Rights Bill of 1866","  This bill sought to weaken the Black Codes. It made blacks US citizens with rights equal to whites. The Civil Rights Bill was passed over President Johnson’s veto. It was the first major piece of legislation passed over a presidential veto."
23, 11," The 14th Amendment—4 provisions   ","  It provided citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the US. It asserted that states may not deprive citizens of life, liberty, or property without due process and that all citizens are entitled to the equal protection of the laws. It declared that any state depriving male citizens of the vote would have its representation in Congress reduced (a provision never enforced). It repudiated the Confederate war debt and stated that slave owners were not to receive compensation for their slaves."
23, 12," Election of 1866","  Urging voters to repudiate the 14th Amendment and to elect a new Congress sympathetic to his views, Johnson campaigned around the country, the ““swing around the circle.”“ But Johnson, humorless and defensive, probably hurt his cause with his weak performance.  The Republicans ““waved the bloody shirt,”“ stirring up wartime hatreds, and achieved smashing victories, winning almost two-thirds of the House and four-fifths of the Senate."
23, 13," Military Reconstruction Act of 1867","  This act, passed over Johnson’s veto, invalidated the governments imposed under the 10% plan and imposed military governors. (Tennessee, having ratified the 14th Amendment, was excepted.) To be readmitted to the Union, a state would have to allow blacks and whites to elect delegates to a state convention that would write a new state constitution granting black suffrage. That constitution would have to be ratified by voters and approved by Congress. When the new state legislature ratified the 14th Amendment, Congress would readmit the state to the Union."
23, 14," 15th Amendment—1870","  This amendment granted the vote to black men as well as white. Republicans supported it because they worried that once Southern states were readmitted, they would amend their state constitutions and deny the vote to blacks.  Republicans also wanted to ensure that blacks—who were loyal Republicans, having been freed by Republican President Lincoln—were able to vote so that Republicans could maintain political control.  Feminist leaders, who had in many cases put aside their struggle while the fight for emancipation continued, pressed unsuccessfully to have the 15th Amendment protect voting rights for women as well."
23, 15," Ex parte Milligan— 1866","  The Supreme Court ruled that military tribunals could not try civilians, even during wartime, in areas where civil courts were open. This was a response to some of Lincoln’s actions during the Civil War. "
23, 16," White Redeemers","  At the end of military Reconstruction, blacks lost political power. All-white governments, known as Redeemer governments, returned to power and reestablished white dominance."
23, 17," The Solid South","  Emancipation and Reconstruction had been imposed by the Northern Republicans. In response, the South voted overwhelmingly for Democrats through the 1960’s. "
23, 18," Carpetbaggers & Corruption in Government","  Carpetbaggers were Northern whites who went south after the Civil War, some to help the freedmen and some to pillage the South. Since so many former Confederates were disenfranchised, the carpetbaggers dominated the governments of the South during Reconstruction. Many of the carpetbag governments instituted important reforms, building roads and schools, expanding the legal rights of women, and guaranteeing civil liberties. However, many of these governments were marked by graft, corruption, and high taxes (as were many governments in the North at this time)."
23, 19," Black Leaders in Reconstruction Governments","  Hiram Revels—A free man born in the North, Revels, a college-educated minister, was the first African American to serve in Congress (though only for part of one term). He was elected to the Senate from Mississippi. While in the Senate, he supported racial equality through compromise and moderation. Blanche K. Bruce—Bruce was the first African American elected to a full term in Congress, representing Mississippi in the Senate. Bruce was known for supporting the rights of black Civil War veterans and blacks in the military. He tried unsuccessfully to integrate the US Army. Robert Smalls—As a slave Smalls was forced into service in the Confederate navy. There he led a mutiny that seized his ship and turned it over to Union forces. Elected from South Carolina to the House of Representatives, Smalls spoke out for legislation barring discrimination in the military and in favor of posting federal troops to control the Red Shirt militias, South Carolina’s version of the KKK."
23, 20," Scalawags","  These were Southern whites who cooperated with the carpetbag governments."
23, 21," Ku Klux Klan & Knights of the White Camellia","  These secret societies used force and terror to prevent blacks from voting and exercising their rights. Scalawags and carpetbaggers were also targets."
23, 22," Force Acts—1870-1871","  These federal laws were intended to use federal troops to halt abuses by the KKK and other groups. Specifically, these acts sought to protect black voters and supervise Southern elections.  The Klan was effectively suppressed by 1872, but the North was not willing to maintain the military presence that would have been needed to protect the rights of the freedmen."
23, 23," Ida B. Wells (also known as Ida B. Wells-Barnett)","  Wells was a crusading journalist who condemned violence against blacks, voting restrictions, and inadequate segregated schools. She was a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. Her best-known reform effort began when a friend of hers was lynched in 1892 for starting a store that competed with white businesses. In response, Wells began a decades-long campaign for an anti-lynching law. Wells also used her newspaper to urge blacks to demand equal rights. This led her into conflict with the accommodationist views of Booker T. Washington."
23, 24," Literacy Tests, Poll Tax, & Grandfather Clause","  These were all techniques to reduce black voting. Literacy tests were not equally difficult for blacks and whites and were often not fairly administered. The poll tax was a tax to be paid before one could vote. Poor blacks often could not afford it. In some states, whites were sent reminders of due dates for this tax while blacks were not. To prevent poor whites from being disenfranchised by the literacy test and poll tax, the grandfather clause allowed a man to vote if his grandfather was eligible to vote prior to Reconstruction. This, obviously, benefited only whites."
23, 25," Tenure of Office Act—1867","  Radical Republicans were angry at what they saw as Johnson’s interference with their plans for Reconstruction. They passed the Tenure of Office Act to limit his power and provide grounds for removing him from office. This act forbade the president from firing top government officials without the consent of the Senate. Johnson proceeded to fire Secretary of War Stanton."
23, 26," Impeachment of President Johnson—1868","  Johnson was impeached by the House for violating the Tenure of Office Act, for seeking to disgrace Congress (his campaign in 1866), and for failure to enforce the Reconstruction acts. The Senate failed by one vote to reach the two-thirds vote needed to convict Johnson. The significance of this was that it preserved the American tradition of the president’s independence from Congress."
23, 27," Seward’s Folly—1867","  Secretary of State Seward bought Alaska from Russia for a bargain price. Seward was mocked for buying a frozen wasteland. But expansionists were cheered by the purchase, and the land eventually turned out to be rich in gas and oil. Key ID’s Ch. 24, 1869-1889 "
24, 1," The Gilded Age","  This was the phrase Mark Twain used to describe the glitter and corruption of the post-Civil War era. Wrote Twain, ““What is the chief end of man?—To get rich. In what way? —Dishonestly if we can; honestly if we must.”“"
24, 2," Waving the Bloody Shirt/Vote As You Shot","  Following the Civil War, the Republicans aroused old wartime animosities to win votes. Representative Ben F. Butler literally waved before the House a bloodstained nightshirt of a carpetbagger flogged by Klan members. "
24, 3," The Tweed Ring, New York City","  The ““Boss”“ Tweed of Tammany Hall, New York’s Democratic political machine, used bribery, graft, and fraudulent elections to defraud the city of $200 million. (This is the equivalent of $3.6 billion in today’s dollars.) Exposed by a New York Times investigation and prosecuted by Samuel Tilden (who eventually won a presidential nomination for his stand against graft), Tweed was sent to prison in 1871."
24, 4," Political Cartoonist Thomas Nast","  Nast attacked Tweed in cartoon after cartoon, despite being offered a large bribe to stop. Nast also developed the symbols of the donkey (Democrats) and elephant (Republicans) as well as much of today’s Santa Claus imagery."
24, 5," Crédit Mobilier Railroad Scandal","  The Union Pacific Railroad was established to build the eastern section of the transcontinental railroad. It created a dummy corporation, the Crédit Mobilier, to do the actual construction, charging the federal government nearly twice the actual cost of the project. When the scheme was discovered, the company tried to bribe Congress and Grant’s vice president with gifts of stock to stop the investigation.  This caused a huge scandal and led to greater public awareness of government corruption. But no one went to jail."
24, 6," The Whiskey Ring","  Treasury officials were taking bribes to allow a group of whiskey distillers to evade excise taxes. Grant’s personal secretary was implicated, but Grant gave a deposition that helped clear the secretary. The cause of this and other scandals can be tied to a lowering of ethical standards during the Civil War and the ascendance of materialistic values. While Grant was personally honest, he was blindly devoted to friends who too often were not. He did not hold his administration to the highest standards of morality."
24, 7," The Currency Controversy ","  Hard versus Soft Money: Hard money advocates, generally creditors who had lent money to others, wanted currency backed by gold; they opposed inflation. Soft money advocates, usually debtors, wanted soft money (paper money not backed by gold) and inflation so they could pay their debts back with cheaper dollars. Greenbacks: Paper currency not backed by gold and hence subject to depreciation. During the Civil War, the North had issued $450 million in greenbacks. The 1875 Resumption Act required the government to withdraw greenbacks from circulation and back all paper currency with gold, a victory for hard money advocates. Silverites: With greenbacks out of the picture, those who wanted inflation asked that paper currency also be backed by silver. With more specie in the government treasury, more paper dollars could be issued, leading to inflation."
24, 8," Crime of ’73","  The Crime of ’73 was the demonetization of silver. For years previously, the government had used both silver and gold for coinage. At the official ratio of 16 ounces of silver = 1 ounce of gold, the government had received very little silver for coinage; silversmiths offered better rates. When huge silver strikes were made in Nevada and Colorado, silver prices dropped, and silver interests denounced the demonetization of silver as a crime and demanded a return to the ““Dollar of Our Daddies.”“"
24, 9," Bland-Allison Act of 1878","  The Bland-Allison Act of 1878 authorized the government to purchase some silver for coinage. But so little was purchased that this had no significant impact on the money supply."
24, 10," Grand Army of the Republic (GAR)","  This was a political organization of Civil War Union veterans who supported Republican candidates. In return, Republicans in Congress provided generous pensions to GAR members."
24, 11," Stalwarts versus Half-Breeds","  The Republicans were split into two factions. The Stalwarts, led by Senator Roscoe Conkling, favored the spoils system, which rewarded political supporters with government jobs. The Half-Breeds, led by Senator James G. Blaine, at least talked about civil service reform (replacing the spoils system with a merit system). In reality, the Half-Breeds were more concerned about controlling the spoils system themselves."
24, 12," Election of 1876","  This election pitted Rutherford B. Hayes, a liberal Republican and Civil War general, against Samuel Tilden, Democrat and reformer who had prosecuted the Tweed Ring. Both favored hard money, civil service reform, and an end to Reconstruction. The Republicans waved the bloody shirt while the Democrats harped on the corruption of the Grant administration.  Hayes received only 165 electoral votes; Tilden received 264,000 more popular votes than Hayes and 184 of the 185 electoral votes needed to win. Twenty electoral votes were disputed, and an electoral commission on a party-line vote gave all twenty to Hayes. "
24, 13," The Compromise of 1877","  The electoral commission awarded all disputed votes to the Republican Hayes. This decision had to be ratified by Congress, but the Democrats controlled the House. Negotiations ensued. The major agreement was that Democrats (mostly from the South) would acquiesce to the commission decision, giving Hayes the presidency if federal troops were removed from the South. In addition, the Democrats won some patronage appointments, and the South received some federal funds for internal improvements."
24, 14," Plessy v. Ferguson—1896","  This decision established the precedent that segregated facilities for blacks and whites were constitutional under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment if separate but equal facilities were provided. In reality, the separate facilities were rarely if ever equal. However, this decision gave Jim Crow laws a legal basis for the next sixty years. "
24, 15," Denis Kearney/Chinese Exclusion Act—1882","  In California Kearney and others (recently arrived European immigrants themselves) resented the even more recently arrived Chinese taking away jobs from white workers. The Chinese faced discrimination, physical abuse, and even murder.  Congress passed a bill restricting the immigration of Chinese laborers, but Hayes vetoed it, arguing that it violated an existing treaty with China. After Hayes left the White House, Congress passed the bill again. "
24, 16," The Assassination of James A. Garfield—1881","  Garfield was a Half-Breed and denied appointments to a number of Stalwarts. Four months into his term of office, he was shot by a deranged office-seeker, Charles Guiteau, who explained, ““I am a Stalwart, and Arthur is president now!”“"
24, 17," Chester Arthur as President—1881-1885","  Arthur, a Stalwart and a symbol of patronage corruption, had been added to the ticket as a sop to the Stalwarts. His ascension to the presidency dismayed reformers, one of whom moaned, ““My God. Chet Arthur in the White House.”“ However, as president Arthur surprised his critics by rising to the level of mediocrity and supporting civil service reform."
24, 18," The Pendleton Act—1883","  The Pendleton Act set up a merit system (based on competitive examinations—not political connections) for many federal jobs. This act also made compulsory campaign contributions from federal employees illegal. An unintended side effect of the Pendleton Act was to strengthen the power of big business; parties had to look to new sources for campaign funds, and they turned to corporations. "
24, 19," The Election of 1884 ","  The Republicans nominated Half-Breed leader James G. Blaine. Republican reformers, known as Mugwumps (from an Algonquin word for renegade chief) and led by Carl Schurz, repudiated Blaine and called on the Democrats to nominate a candidate the Mugwumps could support. The Republicans were further hurt by a minister who condemned the Democrats as the party of ““rum, Romanism, and rebellion.”“ This backfired as it aroused Irish voters to support the Democrats. The Democrats nominated Grover Cleveland, a conservative with a strong record of personal integrity. With Mugwump support, Cleveland won a narrow victory over Blaine."
24, 20," Major Legislation in the Cleveland Administration ","  Interstate Commerce Act—1887: This act forbade rebates or special rates, charging more for short hauls, and pooling (dividing up the business and raising rates). It declared that rates must be reasonable and just, and it required public posting of rates. It was hard to enforce because of vague language, insufficient staff, and the need to appeal to the courts for enforcement.  Dawes Act—1887: The Dawes Severalty Act was intended to help Native Americans assimilate into white culture and provide a transition to citizenship. (Severalty—The Indians were to be treated as a number of separate individuals rather than as unified tribes.) It split up reservations into 160-acre farms. Tribes were dissolved. Unallocated land was often sold off to whites, the proceeds to be used for Indian schools that attempted to exterminate native culture and language.  The Return of Western Lands to Public Domain: Cleveland successfully demanded that railroad and timber companies return 80 million acres of public lands they held illegally. Key ID’s Ch. 25, 1865-1900 "
25, 1," Railroad Construction Post-Civil War","  With the South out of the Congress during the Civil War, Republicans commissioned a northern rail route to the Pacific from Omaha to Sacramento.  The Union Pacific (eastern construction) and Central Pacific (western construction) received generous loans and grants of land for each mile of track laid.  Costs were increased by fraud in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Construction provided jobs for Union veterans and Irish immigrants in the East and Chinese immigrants in the West. The two lines were jointed at Promontory Point, Utah, in 1869. This transcontinental rail line linked the West Coast more tightly to the Union, made trade with Asia easier and more profitable, and facilitated western settlement. Four additional transcontinental rail lines were completed by the end of the century."
25, 2," Federal Support for Economic Development","  Despite the dominant economic philosophy of laissez-faire (which urged no government intervention in the economy), the federal government intervened in a number of ways to encourage economic development during this period. In addition to the generous subsides given to the railroads, the government aided industry through protective tariffs, agriculture benefited from the Homestead Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 (established agricultural experiment stations), and the National Banking Act provided a relatively stable currency."
25, 3," Cornelius Vanderbilt","  A titan of eastern railroads and shipping, Vanderbilt established one of the great family fortunes in American history. Like many of the other robber barons of the Gilded Age, Vanderbilt was less than enchanted with public regulation of his industry, at one point exclaiming, ““What do I care about the law? Hain’t I got the power?”“ His son carried on the family tradition with the phrase ““the public be damned.”“"
25, 4," Railroad Innovations After the Civil War","  Steel rails could carry heavier loads and improved safety. Standard gauge (the width between the rails) eliminated the expense and time needed in transferring freight from one line to another. The Westinghouse air brake improved rail safety. Pullman Palace (sleeper) cars improved comfort for long-distance travelers."
25, 5," Abuses by Railroads","  Stock Watering: Promoters of rail stock often claimed the value of the line’s assets and profits were greater than they actually were. This allowed them to sell more stock (and take in more money) than the company was actually worth. The result was that the railroad operators had to charge excessive rates to pay off these financial obligations. Pooling: Competing railroads might form a pool, an agreement to divide up the business in a particular region. This reduced competitive pressures and kept rates higher. Short Haul & Long Haul Rates: In areas where there was no competing line, a railroad might charge high rates for a short trip since it had a monopoly on rail service in those areas. If freight was being shipped a long distance, competition was more likely, and the cost per mile (or even the total cost) would be lower."
25, 6," Patrons of Husbandry (Grange)—1867 ","  The Grange was originally founded to provide farmers with opportunities for social interaction and for sharing information about farming techniques. But the Grange soon came to focus on farmers’ economic concerns: low crop prices, high prices for farm equipment, and high rates charged by railroads and grain elevators. To deal with some problems, the Grange set up cooperatives to allow them to negotiate better prices for equipment and to establish their own grain elevators. These efforts eventually failed. The Grangers also lobbied state legislatures to pass laws regulating railroad and grain elevator rates. "
25, 7," Munn v. Illinois—1877","  In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Granger laws were constitutional since a state could regulate business taking place within that state (intrastate commerce)."
25, 8," Wabash v. Illinois—1886","  Here the Supreme Court invalidated state laws regulating railroads engaged in interstate commerce. Only Congress could regulate business that crossed state lines."
25, 9," Interstate Commerce Act—1887 ","  This was Congress’s attempt to regulate railroads. But railroads correctly saw it as weak. The Act served to quiet the public calls for regulation without providing effective control of the industry. "
25, 10," Thomas Alva Edison","  Edison was a tireless inventor who developed the light bulb, the phonograph, and the motion picture."
25, 11," The Trusts ","  After the Civil War, business combined in a variety of ways to limit competition and increase profits. Most notable was the trust, perfected by John Rockefeller of Standard Oil. Stockholders in small oil companies assigned their stock to the board of directors of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Co., which then consolidated and coordinated operations of previously competing enterprises. Vertical Integration: Andrew Carnegie of the steel industry mastered this technique. He controlled every stage of producing steel, from mining the iron ore to shipping it to the mills to pouring the ingots of steel; every phase of the process was handled by a Carnegie company. Horizontal Integration: This meant binding together all the competitors to monopolize a given market; this was what Rockefeller was doing with the oil trust."
25, 12," Bessemer Process  ","  Developed in the 1850’s, this technique allowed the cheaper production of steel. "
25, 13," Andrew Carnegie","  Carnegie was a poor immigrant from Scotland who climbed the ladder of success by hard work, talent, and the careful cultivation of powerful friends. By 1900 his company was producing one fourth of the nation’s steel."
25, 14," J.P. Morgan","  Morgan was the titan of finance, dominating the nation’s banking industry. Unlike many of the robber barons of the time, Morgan was scrupulously honest. He used his power to rationalize markets and reduce competition; for example, he bought out Carnegie and a number of other steel producers in 1900 to form US Steel, the nation’s first billion-dollar corporation."
25, 15," John D. Rockefeller","  Pious and moral in his personal life, Rockefeller was completely ruthless in his business operations, eliminating competition in ways both legal and illegal. His company did, however, turn out a superior product at a good price, benefiting the consumer. "
25, 16," Railroad rebates","  A technique Rockefeller used to discourage competition was the railroad rebate. Standard Oil shipped so much oil via rail that Rockefeller could go to the railroads and ask for a rebate on every tank car he shipped, reducing his prices. Eventually, Standard Oil became so powerful that it could demand and receive a rebate on oil shipped by other producers."
25, 17," The Gospel of Wealth","  Using the principles of Social Darwinism, Andrew Carnegie justified the huge fortunes made by Gilded Age robber barons. Carnegie also argued that the wealthy had the responsibility to use their wealth to help others make the climb to success. He wrote, ““The man who dies rich dies disgraced,”“ and gave away much of his fortune to provide communities with libraries, etc."
25, 18," Social Darwinism ","  Yale professor William Graham Sumner became the foremost American proponent of applying to society Darwin’s ideas about natural selection. He made several points: Competition is a natural process that weeds out the weak and rewards the strong, the able, and the wise. Great wealth is simply a sign of superiority, of success. Government should not interfere with this process because that would weaken the race and the society but should simply devote itself to the protection of private property.   Poverty, slums, etc. are the unfortunate but necessary by-products of this natural and beneficial process.  Government attempts to alleviate poverty simply increase the number of the unfit and weakens the society. "
25, 19," 14th Amendment’s Application to Businesses","  One factor that limited the ability of government to regulate business was the Supreme Court’s decision that corporations were persons before the law and that the 14th Amendment applied to them. The Amendment stated that no person could be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This effectively blocked certain attempts at regulation."
25, 20," Sherman Anti-Trust Act—1890","  This sought to ban trusts or other combinations in restraint of trade but it failed to define clearly either ““trust”“ or ““restraint of trade.”“ In addition, businesses were able to combine in forms other than trusts. Its effectiveness was further limited by the Supreme Court, which said only unreasonable restraint of trade was illegal (the rule of reason). It was initially used more to limit labor than business.  "
25, 21," The New South","  In 1886 Atlanta newspaper editor Henry Grady gave a speech proclaiming a New South, one that had moved beyond slavery and secession and that was a loyal section of the Union ready to industrialize and capable of peaceably resolving its racial problems. This promotional effort paid off as northern manufacturers invested in textiles, cigarettes, and steel, taking advantage of southern natural resources and the South’s large pool of cheap labor. However, most of the profits went to the North while the South’s economy lagged and southern blacks remained second-class citizens who worked as sharecroppers and who were controlled by Jim Crow laws."
25, 22," Pittsburgh Plus","  Northern steel barons discouraged the growth of the steel industry in the South by forcing railroads to charge extra for transporting steel from South, a rate known as Pittsburgh Plus. A shipment of steel from Birmingham to Atlanta would have to pay the freight charge from Pittsburgh to Atlanta. "
25, 23," Impact of Industrial Revolution on Workers","  The standard of living rose, even for the working class. Life became more routinized, controlled by the factory whistle rather than by natural rhythms. Women increasingly worked outside the home, leading to delayed marriages and smaller families. Class divisions were accentuated as the upper classes accumulated wealth never before seen in America."
25, 24," Tactics to Destroy Organized Labor","  Scabs: Workers who left the job to strike were often replaced by strikebreakers known as scabs. Injunctions: Court orders declaring a strike or other union action illegal. Often based on the Sherman Antitrust Act. Lockouts: Employers could lock their doors against rebellious employees and starve them into submission. Yellow Dog Contracts: as a condition of employment, workers would have to sign these contracts promising not to join a union. Blacklist: The names of union organizers could be placed on a list that would be circulated among area employers, making it impossible for those union people to find work. Company Towns: Towns where workers lived in company-owned housing shopped at company stores. Control of the workers was easier when employers controlled more than just the job."
25, 25," National Labor Union—1866","  It combined 600,000 skilled and unskilled workers and farmers into one nationwide union. The NLU won an eight-hour day for government workers.  The NLU favored an eight-hour day, limitations on immigration, the establishment of a federal bureau of labor, and currency reform.  One factor that made the NLU different from other labor organizations was that the NLU believed that the interests of labor and management were identical. Therefore, the NLU did not generally believe in going on strike. Instead, they hoped to make progress through arbitration or by lobbying government officials for change. They even started a short-lived political party, the National Labor Reform Party. It folded in 1873. Many of its members then joined the Knights of Labor."
25, 26," The Great Railroad Strike of 1877","  As a result of the 1873 depression, railroads had been struggling to make a profit. So managers of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had cut wages by 35%, doubled train size (increasing both the crews’ work load and the danger), and increased the workday from fifteen to eighteen hours. In July of 1877 yet another pay cut led to a strike that quickly spread through West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.  President Hayes sent federal troops to break up the strike, but in Pittsburgh, 20,000 rail workers and others attacked and drove the federal troops out of the city. The strike spread to railroads throughout the country, but increasing levels of military force ended the strike by August. Following the strike, employers began requiring that workers sign yellow-dog contracts."
25, 27," The Knights of Labor—1869","  Started by Uriah Stephens and later led by Terence Powderly, the Knights admitted both skilled and unskilled workers. They demanded an 8-hour day, abolition of child labor, and limitations on immigration. They advocated temperance, a gradual end to the wage system, and the reorganization of society on cooperative principles. The Knights shared many of the goals of the National Labor Union. But where the NLU had favored achieving change through arbitration or lobbying government officials, the Knights increasingly relied on strikes to win concessions from employers. In addition, the Knights were more inclusive than the NLU in welcoming women and blacks into their union. They faded because they lost several key strikes, because unskilled workers were easily replaced by new immigrants, because their cooperative ventures lost money, and because of the Haymarket Affair. "
25, 28," Haymarket Square Riot—1886","  Chicago workers were demanding an eight-hour day. At a rally, someone threw a bomb at police, killing seven. Eight labor leaders were arrested and convicted of murder even though several had not been present. This led the public to assume that labor unions were full of violent anarchists. Public support for the labor movement dropped off."
25, 29," Samuel Gompers & American Federation of Labor—1886","  Organized by Gompers in 1886, the AFL organized skilled workers into craft unions. It rejected social and utopian goals to focus on winning pay increases (““bread and butter unionism”“) through collective bargaining and strikes. With only skilled workers in their ranks, AFL strikes were more successful because it was harder to find strikebreakers with the requisite skills. Key ID’s Ch. 26, 1865-1900 "
26, 1," Louis Sullivan","  Known as the father of the skyscraper, he designed the first steel-skeleton skyscraper in Chicago in 1885. Sullivan was famous for his design principle, ““Form follows function.”“"
26, 2," Urbanization","  After the Civil War, Americans began a rapid movement to the cities. In 1860, only one-sixth of the nation lived in urban areas (population centers of at least 8000), by 1900 a third lived in urban areas, and by 1920 the majority of Americans lived in urban areas. Factors encouraging urbanization included the demand for workers in factories (which were concentrated in urban areas), the development of skyscrapers (that allowed more people and more businesses to be packed into a concentrated area), street cars and trolleys (that reduced commuting time), and the draw of cultural opportunities. Problems associated with urbanization included poverty, overcrowded slums, disease and lack of sanitation, crime, and political corruption."
26, 3," Dumbbell Tenements","  These were buildings seven or eight stories high with ill-smelling airshafts and communal toilets. They were intended as improvements over earlier designs that lacked natural light and fresh air, but they soon became overcrowded slums. "
26, 4," Social Gospel—1886 ","  Walter Rauschenbusch of New York and Washington Gladden of Columbus preached what they called social gospel, insisting that churches deal with poverty and other significant social issues. These Christian socialists helped to prepare the ground for the Progressive movement."
26, 5," Jane Addams—1889 ","  Addams established Hull House, one of the first American settlement houses, in Chicago. There she helped immigrants and the urban poor by providing childcare and education. Settlement houses such as Addams’s Hull House also encouraged women to become active in the women’s movement and social reform efforts. "
26, 6," Florence Kelley","  Kelley was a noted social reformer who worked to abolish child labor, to pass minimum-wage and maximum work-hours laws, and to enact laws providing health care for mothers and children.  Kelley helped prepare the Brandeis brief in the landmark 1908 Supreme Court case Muller v. Oregon that upheld a ten-hour work day for women."
26, 7," Chautauqua Movement—1874 ","  A successor to the lyceum movement, the Chautauqua lecturers traveled across the country helping to provide adult education. This was one facet of the growing interest in education. During this period, there was a significant increase in the number of high schools, teacher-training schools, and taxpayer-provided textbooks. The illiteracy rate dropped from 20% in 1870 to 11% in 1900."
26, 8," Charles Darwin","  Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published in 1859; in the post-Civil War years, it sparked much controversy between modernists and fundamentalists and was blamed for increasing secularism in American culture. Darwin’s ideas were applied to society by William Graham Sumner in the form of Social Darwinism."
26, 9," Booker T. Washington","  In 1881 Washington founded Tuskegee Institute to give blacks vocational training. Washington’s view was that blacks must first develop their educational and economic resources rather than fight for social equality. Once blacks had achieved economic independence, he said, political and civil rights would follow."
26, 10," W.E.B. Du Bois","  Du Bois helped to establish the NAACP in 1910. He rejected Washington’s gradualist approach, demanding that a ““talented tenth”“ of blacks have immediate access to America’s schools, professions, etc. He urged vigorous activism including court challenges to win equal rights for blacks."
26, 11," Morrill Act—1862","  Passed by the Republican Congress during the Civil War, the Morrill Act granted each state thousands of acres of public lands to be used to support agricultural and industrial colleges. OSU is one such college."
26, 12," Hatch Act—1887","  This provided federal funds to establish agricultural experiment stations in connection with the Morrill land-grant colleges."
26, 13," William James/Pragmatism","  James for many years was America’s leading psychologist and philosopher. His 1907 book Pragmatism argued that truth was to be tested by its practical consequences rather than by theory. This was seen as a philosophy particularly fitting the American character."
26, 14," Yellow Journalism","  Yellow journalism was the use of sensationalism to sell newspapers. Stories focused on the violent, the lurid, the scandalous, the odd. In some cases, yellow journalists exaggerated facts or made up material. Joseph Pulitzer owned the New York World.  The other leading practitioner of yellow journalism was William Randolph Hearst of the New York Journal. "
26, 15," Henry George, Progress and Poverty—1879","  George argued that since the supply of land is fixed and the population is constantly growing, the value of land increases, giving land owners an unearned profit. He proposed a 100% tax on these unearned profits to redistribute wealth and stimulate the economy. His followers were known as single-taxers."
26, 16," Edward Bellamy, Looking Backward—1888","  One of the most influential books of the century, Looking Backward told of a future society with no social injustice. The cause? Government control of the entire economy to benefit the public interest."
26, 17," Horatio Alger","  Alger wrote over 100 books of juvenile fiction. The basic message was that virtue, honesty, and hard work would be rewarded with success and wealth. "
26, 18," Comstock Law—1873","  Anthony Comstock founded the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and demanded that city officials close gambling houses and lottery operations. He went on to a career targeting everything from the writings of George Bernard Shaw to art schools that displayed nude sculpture.  The federal Comstock Law banned, among other things, promoting or writing about contraceptive devices. The law made it illegal to send any ““obscene, lewd, or lascivious”“ books through the mail.  The Comstock Law manifested the conflict over the place of women in society and the tension between traditional and modern culture."
26, 19," Feminism in the Gilded Age","  Elizabeth Cady Stanton: With Anthony, Stanton cofounded the National American Woman Suffrage Association, a radical organization that pressed for women’s right to vote. Beginning in 1868, a constitutional amendment for women’s suffrage was introduced in every Congress until it was adopted in 1920. Susan B. Anthony: In 1872 Anthony voted illegally in the presidential election and was arrested. She wanted to make the argument that, as a citizen, she was due the equal protection of the law under the 14th Amendment and that this included the right to vote. Her case was dismissed by the judge, but in a similar case, the Supreme Court ruled that states could deny the vote to criminals and the insane, and that to deny women the vote was no different.  Carrie Chapman Catt: Catt changed the argument from one that stressed women’s equality with men to one that said women must have the vote if they were to carry out their particular feminine roles of homemaker and mother."
26, 20," Woman’s Christian Temperance Union","  The WCTU was founded in 1874 and headed by Frances Willard. Willard fused the cult of domesticity (the woman’s sphere is the home where she can express her special maternal gifts) with a commitment to political action. Drinking, she felt, threatened thrift and family life. The entrance of women into politics would protect the family and improve public morality.  Carry Nation, wife of an alcoholic, made her mark in the temperance battle by smashing saloons and bars with a hatchet. (Yes, I know the text spells her name Carrie, but in her autobiography, she uses Carry.)"
26, 21," American Protective Association—1887 ","  In response to increasing numbers of Catholic immigrants arriving from southern and eastern Europe, the APA was formed as a secret anti-Catholic organization. The APA aimed to restrict Catholic immigration into the US, to require the ability to speak English as a condition for citizenship, and to remove Catholic teachers from public schools. Members swore never to vote for a Catholic and never to hire a Catholic over a Protestant. At its 1896 peak, the organization claimed 2.5 million members.  Key ID’s Chapter 27, 1865-1890 "
27, 1," Indian Complaint to the Sioux Commission","  The Indians complaint,““Tell your people that since the Great White Father promised that we should never be removed we have been moved five times… I think you had better put the Indians on wheels and you can run them about wherever you wish.”“ "
27, 2," Sand Creek, Colorado—1864","  Colorado miners forced the Indians into a small area called the Sand Creek Reserve where they were running out of food.  Because of this, some began raiding trails and settlements, and the governor called out the militia.  He told the Indians who did not want to fight to go to Fort Lyon where they would be safe. On November 29, 1864, Colonel J.M. Chivington attacked 500 Cheyenne at the Sand Creek Reserve, despite the fact that the Indians were showing both a white flag and a US flag. Four hundred and fifty Indians were killed.    "
27, 3," The Black Hills, South Dakota","  In 1868 a treaty was signed giving the Sioux a large reservation including the Black Hills. In 1874 Colonel George Custer led an expedition into the Black Hills and announced that he had discovered gold; white miners poured into the area in violation of the treaty. "
27, 4," Battle of the Little Big Horn—1876 ","  In response to the invasion of the Black Hills, the Sioux turned to war. Custer was assigned the job of defeating the Indians and forcing them back to the reservation. In June Custer led his men against a superior Indian force led by Crazy Horse at the Little Big Horn River in Montana. Custer’s forces were wiped out, but this was the last victory for the Native Americans, who were inexorably pushed back to the reservations. Why is this battle so famous? Custer was a relentless self-promoter who kept his name and exploits in the papers. Custer was also being seriously considered for the Democratic presidential nomination. And news of Custer’s defeat reached the East just in time for the July 4, 1876, centennial celebration, dampening the festivities."
27, 5," Chief Joseph and the Nez Percé","  The Nez Percé from northeastern Oregon were also pressured to leave their tribal lands and go to a reservation. Chief Joseph led warriors, old people, women, and children on a 1700-mile dash for Canada to escape the fate of confinement on a reservation. A few miles short of their goal, they were finally defeated and sent to a reservation in Kansas. Said Chief Joseph, ““Our chiefs are killed… the old men are all dead… the little children are freezing to death…Hear me my chiefs. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.”“"
27, 6," Factors Leading to the Conquest of the Plains Indians","  Transcontinental railroads brought endless numbers of troops, cattlemen, and farmers. Native Americans showed little resistance to white diseases or to alcohol. The destruction of the great buffalo herds, dropping from perhaps 60 million animals to about 1000, destroyed the Indians’ supply of food, fuel, and hides."

27, 8," Helen Hunt Jackson, A Century of Dishonor—1881","  Jackson was a noted author whose study A Century of Dishonor documented the mistreatment and broken promises of the treatment of Native Americans by the US government."
27, 9," The Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee, South Dakota—1890","  In 1889 Wovoka, a Paiute Indian, claimed he was the Messiah returned to make everything better. If Indians showed their faith by dancing, the buffalo would return, the whites would disappear, and the Indians and their ancestors would enjoy the world as it once was. Sioux danced, ignored their farm work, and made the reservation agents worried that there would be an uprising. The Seventh Cavalry was sent for.   On December 29, 1890, at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, the cavalry searched 350 old men, women, and children for weapons. After two rifles were found and a small scuffle occurred, a gun fired. Soldiers on a hill heard the shot and began firing their Hotchkiss machine guns.  In the end there were about two hundred Indians and thirty-five whites dead. Bullets from their own side killed most of the whites. This was the last major fight of the Indian wars."
27, 10," The Dawes Severalty Act—1887","  This act abolished Indian tribes and gave the heads of Indian families 160 acres of reservation land to farm, with twenty-five years to learn how to handle their own affairs. It also was to grant Indians US citizenship.  Unfortunately, they were not given farm equipment or taught how to farm, and the Office of Indian Affairs didn’t provide proper health care for the reservation Indians.   White speculators bought up about 2/3 of the reservation land. Land not distributed in allotments was put up for sale. Indian minors who inherited land were put under the control of white guardians who often looted the resources of their wards. The 1906 Burke Act postponed citizenship until the end of the twenty-five- year period. "
27, 11," The Long Drive","  Cowboys would drive cattle to railroad terminals (Dodge City, Abilene, Cheyenne) where they were loaded on trains for the slaughterhouses of Chicago and Kansas City. There they were butchered and shipped east in refrigerated rail cars; this practice faded out as more settlers came and fenced the Great Plains.  "
27, 12," Cultural Diversity in the Saddle","  Vaqueros—Mexican cowboys or vaqueros (a term eventually Anglicized to buckaroo) made up about a third of all cowboys on the Great Plains in the 1880’s. Mexicans had been herding cattle in the American Southwest since the time of Juan de Oñate in 1598. Among other things, they added to the vocabulary of ranching with words such as lariat, rodeo, chaps, and pinto. Black Cowboys—Both before and after emancipation, many blacks worked as cowboys. After the Civil War, perhaps one in four cowboys was black. The most famous, because he wrote his memoirs, was Nat Love, a former slave."
27, 13," The Winter of 1886-1887","  This was one factor that helped end the classic cowboy era of the West. This terrible blizzard killed thousands of cattle with temperatures of –68° F."
27, 14," Homestead Act—1862","  The Homestead Act was passed in 1862, giving 160 acres to anyone who would live on the land for five years, build a 12 x 14 dwelling, and raise crops. Although 160 was usually large enough for a farm in the wetter eastern states, on the dry prairie more land was needed for a successful farm. Many homesteaders failed.   By 1900 600,000 claims had been filed, and 80 million acres passed into the hands of individuals.  "
27, 15," John Deere’s Steel Plow—1837 ","  More efficient at breaking up the tough sod of the Great Plains, Deere’s plow was one factor in transforming the area from open cattle ranges to farms."
27, 16," Joseph Glidden’s Barbed Wire—1874 ","  Glidden developed a superior form of barbed wire that facilitated the building of fences on treeless prairies and kept cattle out of crops. It too helped to end the Long Drive."
27, 17," Oklahoma Land Rush—1889","  Oklahoma, at one point set aside as Indian Territory, was opened for white settlement in April of 1889. Many whites tried to sneak in and stake land claims early; they were therefore called sooners. "
27, 18," Census of 1890","  The superintendent of the census announced that, for the first time in America’s history, there was no clearly discernable frontier line. That is, there was no longer a large area unsettled by whites."
27, 19," Frederick Jackson Turner—1893 ","  In response to the closing of the frontier, Turner wrote the most famous essay by an American historian, ““The Significance of the Frontier in American History.”“ In this essay, Turner said the frontier had shaped American life in a variety of ways: 1) it had created social equality, 2) it had encouraged political democracy, 3) it encouraged optimism about the future, 4) it provided a safety valve for workers in the East (thus requiring employers to improve wages and working conditions), 5) it led to wasteful use of the land (since one could always move west and find more land). The closing of the frontier, Turner wrote, had a number of effects on society: 1) Without the western safety valve, urban workers turned to labor unions to improve their plight; tensions between labor and management grew, 2) with less available land, immigrants could not easily obtain farms; they stayed in the cities and competed for industrial jobs, thus leading to calls for limits on immigration, 3) with less free land available, farmers started taking better care of the land; a conservation ethic grew; and 4) American capitalists no longer had the frontier to provide raw materials, new markets, and investment opportunities; America became more imperialistic seeking those benefits overseas."
27, 20," Montgomery Ward—1872","  Farmers more rarely grew or made everything they needed. Now they were more likely to grow one cash crop for market and buy what they needed with the proceeds. Montgomery Ward started catering to the needs of rural Americans with a mail-order catalog. Eventually one could order from Ward everything from sewing needles to an entire house (some assembly required)."
27, 21," Problems Facing American Farmers from 1870-1890","  Mechanization of agriculture drove small farmers who couldn’t afford machines off the land. One-crop farmers’ livelihoods depended on the ever-changing price of that single crop, a price that also depended on the international production level of that crop. Deflation made it harder for farmers to repay their debts, which led to more mortgages and sharecropping. Protective tariffs hurt them by raising the prices of manufactured goods. Trusts raised prices of services they needed; for example, railroad and grain elevator rates were extremely high. As always, farmers were subject to the whims of nature: mile-wide clouds of grasshoppers, droughts, etc."
27, 22," National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry—1867","  The Grange, led by Oliver Kelley, had been established to provide social contact for farmers; its most lasting legacy, to press for laws regulating railroads and grain elevators and to organize cooperative stores and warehouses to eliminate the middleman and increase farmers’ profits.  When the Granger movement died out as a political force for farmers, its role was taken over by three groups known as the Alliances. The Northern Alliance’s main strength lay in the wheat-growing states of Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and the Dakotas. The South Alliance had more than one million white members throughout the Southern states. Black farmers in the South belonged to a separate group, the Colored Farmers’ Alliance.  The Alliances pressed for Granger laws to regulate railroads (on a state basis). Eventually, the alliances came to believe that they needed a third party to achieve their goals. They organized the National People’s party (soon known as the Populists). "
27, 23," The People’s Party or Populists—1892","  Believing that eastern economic powers controlled both major political parties, the farmers decided to organize their own party. The Populists demanded 1) free and unlimited coinage of silver at sixteen to one, 2) a graduated income tax, 3) government ownership of railroad, telegraph, and telephone systems, 4) a secret ballot and direct election of US senators, and 5) shorter working hours and restrictions on immigration (to appeal to urban workers). In the 1892 presidential election, the Populists took twenty-two electoral votes, a substantial number for a third party."

28, 1," William Jennings Bryan’s Cross of Gold Speech—1896","  This was the speech that clinched the 1896 Democratic nomination for Bryan. Demanding that the gold standard be abandoned, Bryan concluded, ““You shall not press down upon the brow of labor the crown of thorns; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.”“ With Bryan and the Democrats claiming their main policy proposal, the Populists also endorsed Bryan for the presidency. It was the end of the Populist party as a national force as they were absorbed into the Democrats."
28, 2," Czar Reed","  The dominating Republican Speaker of the House, Reed was a master at maneuvering legislation through Congress. He presided over the ““Billion-Dollar Congress”“ in 1889-1891."
28, 3," Sherman Silver Purchase Act—1890","  This act increased the amount of silver purchased by the federal government for coinage, but, like the Bland-Allison Act, it had little impact on inflation. Cleveland pressured Congress into repealing the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893, ending the government’s purchase of silver for coinage."
28, 4," McKinley Tariff—1890","  This boosted tariff rates, which hurt farmers. The result was that the Republicans lost their majority in the House in the next election. And the Farmers’ Alliance elected nine representatives to Congress."
28, 5," Jim Crow and the Populists","  Initially the Populists in the South tried to make common cause with black farmers since they faced common economic problems. In response, Southern white conservatives played up race prejudice to divide white and black Populists, worked to restrict black suffrage, and passed Jim Crow laws that imposed strict racial segregation. The tactics worked; black and white Populists were split apart. "
28, 6," Coxey’s Army—1894","  With widespread unemployment during the Panic of 1893, Populist Jacob Coxey demanded that the government put the unemployed to work building roads. The ““Army”“ consisted of Coxey and 500 demonstrators who marched to Washington where Coxey was arrested for walking on the grass at the Capitol. His army then melted away."
28, 7," The Pullman Strike—1894","  In the Panic of 1893, Pullman laid off a third of his workers and cut wages five times in one year. Rents for the company houses and prices in the company stores stayed the same, however.  This led to a strike that shut down rail traffic in the western half of the country. The railroads convinced President Cleveland that the strike was blocking the delivery of US mails. This was untrue, but Cleveland sent in troops to help break up the strike. In addition, the railroads used the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, designed to limit the power of corporations, to get an injunction ending the strike.  "
28, 8," Wilson-Gorman Tariff—1894","  Democrats had pledged to reduce tariff rates, but by the time the bill made it through Congress, so many protections for specific special interests had been added that it reduced rates very little from the high McKinley Tariff. Cleveland, disgusted, allowed the bill to become law without his signature. The Wilson-Gorman bill also included a provision for an income tax on incomes over $4,000. The Supreme Court overturned this provision in 1895, convincing the Populists that the courts were in the control of the rich."
28, 9," William Harvey, Coin’s Financial School—1894 ","  The Populist proposal for the free coinage of silver was boosted by the publication of this pamphlet. Harvey explained monetary policy in simple terms and claimed that the free coinage of silver would eliminate debt and end the depression."
28, 10," The Election of 1896","  While Bryan traveled the country giving hundreds of speeches, McKinley, at the advice of his campaign manager Marcus Hanna, ran a different campaign. McKinley stayed on his front porch in Canton, Ohio, where he greeted and spoke to 750,000 people (many of whom were hauled in by the Republican party). In addition, Hanna had rounded up enough campaign contributions to outspend Bryan by more than ten to one. Bryan’s campaign focused on free silver, a position that urban voters thought would lead not just to higher prices to help farmers but to high food prices for the rest of the country. McKinley, whose campaign promoted the gold standard and high tariffs and who warned workers that they would lose their jobs if Bryan were elected, won easily. "
28, 11," Dingley Tariff—1897","  McKinley kept his campaign pledges. This raised tariff rates to new highs. "
28, 12," Inflation Without Silver","  Prosperity returned to the nation in 1897. As demand picked up, farm prices rose. Gold strikes in the Klondike, Alaska, Australia, and South Africa increased the gold supply and, in turn, the money supply. After a long period of deflation, the economy entered an era of moderate inflation (rising prices). As a result, the money issue faded from politics. Key ID’s Ch. 29, 1890-1899 "
29, 1," Alfred T. Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power upon History","  Admiral Mahan argued persuasively that control of the sea was the key to world dominance. He said that the US needed a modern fleet, naval bases in the Caribbean, a canal across Panama, and bases on Hawaii and other Pacific islands.  Mahan was proposing an extension of Social Darwinism—be a strong naval power or be trampled in the race of history."
29, 2," Venezuelan Boundary Dispute—1895-1896","  Britain and Venezuela had long argued over the border between Venezuela and British Guiana. When gold was discovered in the area, the dispute became more intense. In response to the Venezuelan boundary dispute, Secretary of State Richard Olney told England that it was violating the Monroe Doctrine, that England should submit the dispute to arbitration, and that despite Britain’s naval superiority the US was in control in the Western Hemisphere. Britain’s response denied the relevance of the Monroe Doctrine and rejected arbitration. War between the US and Britain loomed, but fortunately for the US, the British had more problems with the Germans, Russians, and French. Britain agreed to arbitration. The final decision gave Britain most of what it had originally claimed. The significance of this was that it enhanced the standing of the Monroe Doctrine. It also signaled the beginning of improved relations between the US and Great Britain."
29, 3," Queen Liliuokalani and Dole’s Revolution—1893","  American business dominated Hawaii’s sugar industry, and thousands of immigrants arrived (Chinese, Portuguese, and Japanese) to work in the cane fields. As a result, the Hawaiian natives were outnumbered almost two to one.   In 1887 Hawaiian-born white businessmen forced a change in the constitution so that only the landowners or the wealthy could vote; this disenfranchised most native Hawaiians.  In 1891 Queen Liliuokalani announced her intention to remove property qualifications for voting. White business groups rebelled, invited in US marines, and overthrew the queen.  Despite President Cleveland’s desire to do justice and restore the queen, this could not be done without armed intervention. Congress adopted a hands-off policy for several years but agreed to annex Hawaii when the war with Spain came. "
29, 4," Cuban Rebellion—1894-1898","  Spain denied Cubans civil liberties, extracted heavy taxes, and restricted foreign trade. The rebellion against Spanish rule was led by Josè Marti, a poet and journalist who had spent much of his life in exile in New York City. Unable to defeat the Spanish troops in battle, the rebels took to the hills and began an active guerrilla campaign. They planned on destroying American-owned sugar mills and plantations, hoping that this would force the US to intervene and that this intervention would eventually lead to freeing Cuba from Spain.  The Spanish general Weyler, known as the Butcher in the American press, responded by moving Cubans into concentration camps where 200,000 died, one-eighth of the total Cuban population, from disease and malnutrition.   Americans were sympathetic to the plight of Cubans fighting for freedom. This sympathy was strengthened by the reports in the yellow press and by imperialists such as Theodore Roosevelt and Admiral Mahan who were calling for war for territorial expansion."
29, 5," William Randolph Hearst & Yellow Journalism","  Yellow journalists William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer tried to boost circulation by headlining exaggerated accounts of Spanish atrocities. Hearst sent artist Frederic Remington to Cuba to provide pictures of the war. Remington reportedly cabled Hearst that he could find no war. Hearst is said to have replied, ““You furnish the pictures, and I’ll furnish the war.”“ A young Cuban woman was jailed for resisting a sexual assault by a Spanish officer. Hearst sent a reporter who helped her escape and brought her to New York, accompanied by sensational headlines in Hearst’s newspapers."
29, 6," The De Lôme Letter—Feb. 1898","  De Lôme, the Spanish ambassador to Washington, wrote a private letter to a friend in Cuba. The letter was stolen from the mail and published in America. It accused President McKinley of being a weak politician who swayed in the winds of public opinion. Although American critics such as Roosevelt were saying worse of McKinley, this aroused American national pride and helped push the nation closer to war with Spain."
29, 7," U.S.S. Maine—Feb. 1898","  The Maine had been sent to Havana to remind Spain of America’s power and to evacuate US citizens in case of hostilities. On February 15, 1898, the Maine mysteriously exploded in the harbor; 260 Americans died. Though the cause was never determined for certain (spontaneous combustion in a coal bunker seems most likely), Americans, encouraged by yellow journalism, blamed Spain and called for war."
29, 8," McKinley’s Request for War with Spain—Apr. 1898","  McKinley was reluctant to go to war; he had seen war firsthand as an officer in the Civil War, and Mark Hanna and Wall Street were concerned that war would unsettle business. McKinley demanded of Spain an armistice and an end to the concentration camps; further, he told Spain that he thought Cuban independence was the logical result of such an armistice. Spain agreed to his demands. Nonetheless, McKinley bent to pressure from Congress and the public and asked for a declaration of war.  "
29, 9," The Teller Resolution","  Senator Teller appended to the war resolution an amendment pledging that the US had no territorial ambitions in the war with Spain, that the fight was only to free Cuba, and that at the end of the war the US would hand the Cuban people their freedom and depart. Imperialistic Europeans scoffed at this rejection of realpolitik."
29, 10," Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt","  Roosevelt was an enthusiastic imperialist eager for war. One day when his boss, Secretary of the Navy John Long, was out of the office, TR cabled Commodore Dewey to attack the Philippines (owned by Spain) in event of war. McKinley eventually confirmed TR’s order."
29, 11," Commodore George Dewey","  Dewey captured Manila Bay with the loss of no American lives while he destroyed or captured the Spanish ships. Of significance was the fact that Germany, hoping to gain control of the islands, sent a fleet. In contrast, the British fleet in the area acted with friendship toward the Americans; Britain feared the rising power of Germany and saw in the US a potential ally."
29, 12," Annexation of Hawaii—July 1898","  The fighting in the Philippines persuaded the US that it needed Hawaii as a coaling station for its Southeast Asian adventures. Congress annexed the islands and McKinley approved."
29, 13," Emilio Aguinaldo and the Philippine Islands","  Aguinaldo had been leading a Philippine revolt against Spanish rule for two years before Dewey’s victory. When war broke out between Spain and America, Aguinaldo agreed to help the US with the understanding that the Philippines would receive their independence. But imperialists in the US wanted to take over all of Spain’s empire. McKinley eventually concluded that it was America’s divine mission to control and Christianize the islands, ignoring the fact that they had been Christians for hundreds of years by this time.  Aguinaldo then led his guerilla forces in a bloody four-year war in which 4,000 Americans and 20,000 Filipinos died. Postwar congressional hearings told of US forces executing prisoners, using torture, and burning villages. The Philippines did not receive their independence until 1946."
29, 14," TR’s Rough Riders","  Roosevelt, eager for war, recruited a group of cowboys, polo players, and other volunteers and headed for Cuba as a colonel. The Rough Riders fought in one of the few significant land battles of the war at San Juan Hill and nearby Kettle Hill.  This helped make TR a figure of national prominence. "
29, 15," American Unpreparedness","  Though the US won a quick victory, this was due more to Spanish weakness than to American strength. The military was not prepared to fight a war, especially not in the tropics. The army issued the troops heavy woolen uniforms. It fed the troops spoiled food (embalmed beef was the term). It was not ready to deal with tropical diseases or dysentery. The US suffered only 400 battle deaths but 5000 deaths due to sickness."
29, 16," Treaty of Paris—1899","  Spain agreed to leave Cuba, to cede Puerto Rico and Guam to the US, and to sell the Philippine Islands to the US for $20 million (the Philippines had been captured the day after the armistice was signed). "
29, 17," The Anti-Imperialist League","  Not all Americans favored imperial expansion. The Anti-Imperialist League united steel baron Andrew Carnegie with union leader Samuel Gompers, along with luminaries such as Mark Twain and philosopher William James. "
29, 18," Rudyard Kipling, ““White Man’s Burden”“","  British poet Kipling represented one voice in the pro-imperialism chorus. He argued that America had a duty to uplift the less developed nations of the world."
29, 19," The Role of William J. Bryan in Ratifying the Treaty of Paris ","  The anti-imperialists and those troubled by the insurrection in the Philippines opposed Senate ratification of the treaty in the Senate. Passage was uncertain. Bryan, the 1896 and likely 1900 Democratic nominee, became an unexpected ally of the treaty. He argued that the sooner the US took official control of the Philippines, the sooner it could give them their freedom. He persuaded several Democrats to vote for the treaty; it passed by one vote."
29, 20," The Insular Cases—1901","  In the 1901 Insular Cases, the Supreme Court decided that residents of US territories such as the Philippines and Puerto Rico were not necessarily US citizens and did not enjoy all the rights of citizenship. The rights enjoyed would be determined by Congress, not by simple US possession of territory."
29, 21," Dr. Walter Reed","  Reed, an army doctor, led the team that discovered that a mosquito transmitted yellow fever, the leading cause of death of American troops in the Spanish-American War."
29, 22," The Platt Amendment—1902","  After the Spanish-American War, the US wrote much of the constitution for Cuba. This made Cuba a protectorate of the US. It stated that 1) Cuba was not to make any treaties that might limit its independence, 2) Cuba was not to permit any foreign power to control any part of its territory, 3) the United States was to have the right to intervene in Cuba’s internal affairs to protect Cuban independence and ““for the protection of life, property, and individual liberty,”“ 4) Cuba was not to go into debt beyond its ability to repay, and 5) the United States could buy or lease land on the island for coaling or naval stations.  Under the Platt Amendment, the US sent troops to Cuba to intervene in Cuban politics four different times.  The Platt Amendment was finally abrogated in 1934. Key ID’s Ch. 30, 1899-1909 "
30, 1," Philippine Insurrection","  Despite much domestic controversy, the US annexed the Philippines in 1899. The Filipinos sought independence, not further colonial control, and they rebelled. Although Americans expected a brief conflict, the war lasted several years. The war was brutal with the US Army relying on a terror campaign: concentration camps similar to Weyler’s in Cuba were established, a Filipino prisoner was executed for every American killed, Filipino homes were burned whenever telegraph lines were cut, Filipinos’ farm animals were killed and crops destroyed, and any Filipino suspected of aiding the rebels was executed without trial. In addition, 70,000 US troops were black; the irony of their fight against dark-skinned people seeking independence when the black troops faced discrimination at home led many to desert. "
30, 2," Benevolent Assimilation","  The US goal in the Philippines was benevolent assimilation. The US spent millions of dollars on roads, sanitation, and education for the Philippines. Economic ties, especially trade in sugar, were established. But the Filipinos preferred freedom and struggled against US control."
30, 3," Portsmouth Conference—1905 ","  Although the US initially supported Japan in its war with Russia, Roosevelt came to be concerned that Japanese success posed a threat of its own. At Japan’s request, TR attempted to negotiate peace between the two sides in a conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The Japanese received the southern half of Sakhalin Island and Russia’s sphere of influence in Manchuria but no indemnity for losses suffered.  Roosevelt was hailed for bringing the war to an end and received the Nobel Peace Prize. The significance of this is that Japanese imperialism was encouraged by the victory over a European power, but Japan was unhappy that it did not win more in the settlement. The US came to see Japan as a world power that could threaten US interests in the Far East."
30, 4," Hay-Pauncefote Treaty—1901","  The 1850 Clayton-Bulwer Treaty had promised that neither the US nor Great Britain would fortify or secure exclusive control of any isthmian waterway. Britain feared that the US would unilaterally abrogate this treaty and so sought to negotiate a new agreement giving the US exclusive canal rights. The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty gave the US the right to build and fortify a canal. The British received in exchange the US agreement that the treaty would be open to ships of all nations on equal terms."
30, 5," Algeciras Conference—1906 ","  France and Germany were in conflict over trading rights in Morocco. The tensions threatened to ignite a war involving all major European powers. Germany asked Roosevelt to support an international conference to work out a deal. TR did so. The Algeciras Conference upheld the Open Door policy for all major powers. American critics complained that US participation violated the US tradition of nonentanglement in foreign affairs and that US involvement in the Old World weakened the Monroe Doctrine. TR’s supporters argued that US involvement was justified since a European war could drag in the US."
30, 6," Spheres of Influence ","  These were regions in China where foreign imperialistic powers enjoyed economic monopolies. They licensed businesses, controlled tariff rates, set railroad rates, and determined harbor fees. Connected to this was the concept of extraterritoriality. This meant that a foreign national, a German, for example, who was accused of committing a crime in China would be tried in a German court. Both the economic monopolies and extraterritoriality were affronts to Chinese sovereignty."
30, 7," Open Door Policy—1899 ","  Spheres of influence limited US access to the Chinese market. Secretary of State John Hay therefore recommended an Open Door policy. This would allow all nations equal trading rights in China. He sent letters to the European powers asking that they accept this policy. The other nations accepted conditionally or diplomatically deflected Hay’s request. Hay, however, announced that all parties had accepted the proposal and that it was in effect."
30, 8," Boxer Rebellion—1900 ","  Many Chinese resented foreign domination of their nation. A group called the Harmonious Righteous Fists (known in the West as the Boxers) killed thousands of foreigners, occupied Beijing, and laid siege to the district housing the foreign embassies. Imperial powers including the US contributed troops to an army that defeated the Boxers and rescued the threatened diplomats. The victorious imperialists demanded reparations from China. The US feared that China’s territory might be divided among the victors. Secretary Hay urged China to pay in money rather than land and announced that the US was determined to protect China’s territorial integrity. In addition, the US refunded to China part of the money paid as reparations. This helped to cement good relations between the US and China."
30, 9," Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty—1903 ","  Colombia owned Panama (where the US wanted to build a canal). Secretary Hay negotiated a treaty with Colombia for a 100-year lease on a six-mile-wide strip of land across Panama. The US Senate approved the treaty, but the Colombian government decided that it would be unconstitutional to sell part of its nation. TR was furious, charging that Colombia simply was holding out for a better deal; he may have been right. Pro-canal forces in Panama talked of seceding from Colombia. The US indicated that it would approve of such action. The revolt occurred, and US forces prevented Colombian intervention. Hay negotiated a perpetual lease of a canal zone with his Panamanian counterpart Philippe Bunau-Varilla, thus clearing the way for construction of a US canal. The treaty also allowed the US to intervene in Panama when necessary to preserve order."
30, 10," Panama Canal","  Construction began in 1906. The canal was finally completed in 1914 at cost of $400 million.  The American actions led to long-term tension with Colombia and increased suspicion of the US on the part of Latin America. During the Harding administration, the US eventually paid Colombia $25 million ““to remove all misunderstanding.”“ Coincidentally, oil had just been discovered in Colombia, and this payment made it possible for US oil companies to operate in Colombia.  In 1977 President Carter signed a treaty that would return the canal to Panamanian control in 1999."
30, 11," Roosevelt Corollary","  Several Latin American nations were behind in their debt repayments to European powers. In some cases, the Europeans were willing to use military might to force repayment. President Roosevelt worried that this forceful debt collection would lead to a permanent European presence in the Western Hemisphere. TR announced a policy of preventive intervention, stating that the US had the right to intervene in the internal affairs of Latin American nations in the case of ““chronic wrongdoing.”“ "
30, 12," Big Stick Diplomacy","  The first example of the Roosevelt Corollary in action was when the US took over tariff collections in the Dominican Republic in 1905. The US intervention lasted over two years. Roosevelt also sent US forces to Cuba in 1906. "
30, 13," Gentlemen’s Agreement—1907-1908 ","  In 1906 Japanese, Chinese, and Korean schoolchildren in San Francisco were sent to segregated schools. Japan protested this insult. Talk of war was heard in both Japan and the US. Roosevelt pressured the San Francisco school board to rescind the order. Japan promised to halt the emigration of Japanese workers to the US."
30, 14," Great White Fleet","  To ensure that the Japanese did not interpret the Gentlemen’s Agreement as a sign of weakness on the part of the US, Roosevelt sent a fleet of sixteen US battleships on an around-the-world tour as a demonstration of US might. The fleet was received warmly in Japan."
30, 15," Root-Takahira Agreement—1908 ","  The US and Japan promised to respect each other’s territorial possessions in the Pacific and to uphold the Open Door policy in China. Key ID’s Ch. 31, 1901–1912 "
31, 1," Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class—1899","  Economist Thorstein Veblen argued that the accumulation of money and its lavish display is the modern equivalent of displaying trophies won in war. This is how members of the leisure class demonstrate their strength and dominance. The leisure class is admired by the lesser members of the society who try to imitate them through conspicuous consumption (consumption intended to impress others with one’s wealth and power) and even waste of money as means of demonstrating personal dominance over others. This leads to social stability, for the lower classes do not rebel against the rich who may be taking their money and exploiting them. Rather the lower classes admire the rich and seek to emulate them, hoping to be exploiters themselves one day. "
31, 2," Jacob A. Riis, How the Other Half Lives—1890","  Riis’s book showed the gritty reality of the life of the poor in the New York slums. Riis’s book and its shocking photographs helped to motivate Theodore Roosevelt, then New York City police commissioner, to become involved in tenement reform."
31, 3," Muckrakers","  This was the term Roosevelt applied to journalists who wrote attention-grabbing stories about poverty, crime, political corruption, etc. TR meant this as a criticism of those who saw only the problems in society. However, unlike the yellow journalists, the muckrakers were generally accurate in their stories and hoped to stimulate social reform, not just sell newspapers."
31, 4," Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities—1902","  In this book, Steffens exposed corruption in city governments, the bribery of government by businessmen, and the public apathy this evoked."
31, 5," Ida M. Tarbell, History of the Standard Oil Company—1904 ","  This book denounced the means by which John Rockefeller accumulated his oil fortune. Tarbell’s father, a small businessman in the oil refining industry, had been ruined by Rockefeller’s ruthless business practices."

Sinclair had expected it to lead to an improvement in working conditions, but instead it led to passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act, designed to protect consumers.  "
31, 10," Progressives—their composition, leaders, results in comparison with Populists","  Populists were mainly farmers (generally lower class) who managed to elect some public officials and pass several laws leading to regulation of railroads and grain elevators. The Populist movement was primarily a rural movement of the Midwest and South. Progressives were primarily members of the middle class who felt squeezed between the giant corporations and by the increasingly active labor unions. Progressives were found in all regions and both parties. Progressives had broader support and managed to pass a wider variety of laws than did the Populists. "
31, 11," Initiative, Referendum, & Recall","  These were all part of the Progressive effort to return power to the hands of the middle-class voter in an effort to battle corruption and political abuse. The initiative allows bills to be written by citizens and placed on the ballot when sufficient signatures are gathered. The referendum allows voters to have a chance to approve or reject a law passed by the legislature. The recall allows voters to remove an official from office, particularly in cases of corruption."
31, 12," Australian Secret Ballot","  Prior to 1892, ballots listing only favored candidates were provided by candidates, parties and newspapers. The Australian innovation adopted by Vermont was the use of government-printed ballots that listed all qualifying candidates. Prior to this, voters could prepare ballots at home or simply pick up party ballots on their way to the polls. Voters had no need to mark ballots; they simply had to deposit them in the ballot box. The Australian secret ballot limited vote fraud. It was now less attractive to bribe someone to vote a certain way since the secret ballot made it difficult to know how a voter cast his ballot. By 1910 all states had adopted this system."
31, 13," Direct Primary","  This began in Wisconsin in 1903. It allows voters to choose each party’s nominees for the general election. Prior to this, nominees had generally been chosen by the party bosses."
31, 14," Millionaires’ Club","  This was a disparaging term for the US Senate. Trusts often dominated the state legislatures, which chose senators. The senators were often wealthy men with the interests of the upper class at heart."
31, 15," 17th Amendment—1913","  This amendment provided for the direct election of US senators by the voters."
31, 16," Reforming Local Government ","  Lincoln Steffens had pointed out the corruption common in city governments. In 1901 Galveston, Texas, replaced its previous government with one where expert commissioners headed various departments (police, sanitation, roads, etc.). In 1913 Dayton, Ohio, developed the city manager system under which a professional manager carried out the day-to-day administration of city business while a mayor and council made major policy decisions. "
31, 17," Anti-Saloon League","  The W.C.T.U., one million women led by Frances Willard, continued their agitation for prohibition. Aided by the Anti-Saloon League, they had made half the country dry by the outbreak of WWI. Opposition to prohibition was greatest in urban areas with high immigrant populations. Those immigrants were used to ready access to alcohol in Europe."
31, 18," Eighteenth Amendment—1919","  This amendment prohibited the manufacture or sale (but not the consumption) of alcohol. "
31, 19," Triangle Shirtwaist Fire—1911","  There had recently been a garment workers’ strike that won some concessions for many New York City garment workers. The Triangle Shirtwaist Company did not make concessions, and their workers returned to work in a factory many considered dangerous. When fire broke out, there were no sprinklers and there was much flammable material on the floors. Doors were locked except for one that opened inward. Many workers jumped from upper windows. One hundred forty-six died.  The owners were acquitted of manslaughter charges; it was an act of God, the jury said. But it did lead to an investigation of New York state labor conditions and new laws for New York state including better fire codes for factories, a fifty-four-hour week for women and children, no Sunday work, and a ban on child labor for children under fourteen. "
31, 20," Lochner v. New York—1905","  The Supreme Court struck down a New York law imposing a ten-hour maximum workday for bakers. The Court said that under the Fourteenth Amendment, workers and employers were free to enter into any contractual agreement they liked; states could not interfere with that freedom.  This ruling effectively blocked attempts to improve conditions for workers."
31, 21," Muller v. Oregon—1907","  In this case, the Supreme Court upheld an Oregon law imposing a ten-hour maximum workday for female laundry workers. The Court said this law did not violate employers’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause. The case was significant as a step for the Progressive movement in regulating business. It was also significant because the court accepted the brief from attorney Louis Brandeis presenting not just legal arguments but also arguments about the impact of this law on society (an approach the Court also accepted in the 1954 Brown case)."
31, 22," Square Deal","  Theodore Roosevelt said that government should ensure that both business and government were honest and that individuals should have greater economic opportunities. He offered all elements of society—business, labor, farmers, and consumers—a Square Deal. The Square Deal comprised control of corporations, consumer protection, and conservation of natural resources."
31, 23," Anthracite Coal Strike—1902","  Previous presidents had often called out the troops to break strikes. Roosevelt felt that labor did have the right to organize and bargain collectively. When the United Mine Workers struck for union recognition, higher wages, and shorter hours, TR called miners and owners to the White House to talk. When the owners refused an offer of arbitration, TR threatened to seize the mines; owners then agreed to arbitration. The miners won shorter hours and a wage increase but not union recognition. This was significant as it established a precedent for expanded presidential powers."
31, 24," Mother Jones","  Mary Harris Jones, more popularly known as Mother Jones, was an activist for workers’ rights in the early twentieth century. Called by one opponent ““the most dangerous woman in America,”“ she was a passionate speaker who organized protests and supported strikes. She was often jailed by authorities. Much of her work was in support of miners and child workers. In 1903 she led a protest march of child textile workers from Philadelphia to President Theodore Roosevelt’s home on Long Island, New York, in an attempt to end child labor."
31, 25," Trust-busting—Northern Securities Company—1902-1904","  Northern Securities was a holding company controlled by J.P. Morgan and James J. Hill. It sought a rail monopoly in the Northwest. Roosevelt’s government sued under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The Supreme Court ordered the Northern Securities Company dissolved."
31, 26," Good v. Bad Trusts","  Roosevelt’s administration took action against more than forty trusts, but this action was not an unlimited attack on trusts. Roosevelt did feel that business needed to be regulated for the common good. But he also felt that big businesses were efficient and appropriate in many cases. The question was not one of size but of the impact on the public good. For example, TR approved of J.P. Morgan’s plan to expand US Steel."
31, 27," Meat Inspection Act—1906","  Inspired by Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle, this law mandated government inspection of meat shipped across state lines, whether live animals, carcasses, or meat ready for the consumer. Large meatpackers acquiesced to this regulation. It put fly-by-night operators out of business, and it gave the consumers more confidence in their product."
31, 28," Pure Food & Drug Act—1906","  A companion to the Meat Inspection Act, this banned the sale of adulterated foods or drugs and required accurate labeling of ingredients."
31, 29," John Muir","  Muir was a preservationist. He sought to protect natural treasures such as Yosemite and Hetch Hetchy valleys from development. He was a founder of the Sierra Club."
31, 30," Gifford Pinchot","  Pinchot, America’s first professional forester and the first head of the US Forest Service, took a different view than Muir. Pinchot favored ““wise use”“ of natural resources. That is, he sought, not permanent protection from development, but the efficient use of resources, avoiding the waste all too common in logging, mining, and other resource-extraction industries of the time. Roosevelt generally sided with Pinchot."
31, 31," Newlands Act—1902","  To encourage development of the West, the government sold public lands and used that money to fund irrigation projects in arid regions. Farmers who benefitted from these irrigation projects paid fees for water use. Those funds were then used to fund further irrigation projects."
31, 32," Dollar Diplomacy","  President Taft’s foreign policy encouraged US business to invest in sensitive regions, especially in the Caribbean and China. If American business soaked up investment opportunities there, then it would be less likely that other imperial powers, say, Russia or Germany, would be tempted to move into those areas. In other words, American business could aid American foreign policy in expanding American influence. In addition, Taft backed up the American companies investing in these crucial areas with military force when necessary. For example, when revolution broke out in Nicaragua, the government sent in Marines to safeguard American interests."
31, 33," Payne-Aldrich Tariff—1909","  The Republicans had argued for lower tariff rates on the basis that protective tariffs were the mother of trusts. Taft called on Congress to pass a lower tariff; the House reduced rates slightly, but the Senate added amendment on amendment, raising rates on many items. Taft not only signed the bill, but praised it effusively. This led to a split in the Republican party between conservatives and progressives, foreshadowing the Bull Moose third-party effort in 1912."
31, 34," Ballinger-Pinchot quarrel—1910","  Taft removed Roosevelt’s secretary of the interior and appointed his own man, Richard A. Ballinger. Ballinger returned to public sale many water-power sites plus extensive coal fields and timberlands that Roosevelt had previously withdrawn. When Pinchot, Roosevelt’s appointee as head of the Forest Service protested, Taft restored some of the lands to the forest reserve. But he fired Pinchot. This also increased the gap between Taft’s conservative supporters and TR and the progressives.    Key ID’s Ch. 32, 1912-16 "
32, 1," Platform of the Progressive (Bull Moose) Party—New Nationalism","  The New Nationalism was based on the ideas of political scientist Herbert Croly who supported the continued consolidation or growth of labor unions and trusts along with the growth of government regulatory agencies. TR argued that the national government was the only force strong enough to bring about improvements for the nation as a whole. In other words, TR felt that big business was inevitable and could be beneficial; however, it had to be controlled by big government. In addition, the Progressive party favored woman suffrage, minimum wage laws, lower tariffs, and social security."
32, 2," Platform of Wilson—New Freedom","  The New Freedom was based on the ideas of lawyer and social critic Louis Brandeis who believed that bigness, whether in government or business, was inherently bad. Rather than build up powerful regulatory agencies to control trusts, Woodrow Wilson favored laws that dismantled trusts and restored competition. Wilson wanted fewer monopolies and less regulation to allow the ““man on the make,”“ as opposed to the ““men who are already made,”“ to succeed. In other words, Wilson favored an economy made up of small businesses; this would mean that less government regulation would be needed. In addition, Wilson favored low tariffs, limiting the use of injunctions against unions, and low-interest loans to farmers."
32, 3," The Election of 1912—4 parties ","  Eugene Debs was the nominee of the Socialist Party. He won 6% of the popular vote, a very respectable showing for a minor party. Taft won the Republican nomination but did not campaign vigorously. He finished third. Roosevelt was rejected by the Republicans and nominated by the Progressive or Bull Moose Party. He finished second, the high-water mark for a third party in American politics. Wilson, the Democrat, captured 42% of the popular vote and the majority in the Electoral College because of the split in the Republican Party."
32, 4," Wilson’s Weaknesses & Character Flaws as a Politician","  Although Wilson was intelligent, was motivated by clear ideals, and was an effective public speaker, his cold public persona, his intellectual elitism, and his inability to compromise handicapped him."
32, 5," Underwood Tariff—1913","  Wilson spoke effectively to Congress and the people in favor of tariff reform. He urged the people to help him counter the ““Third House of Congress,”“ the lobbyists seeking special tariff protection for their industries.  The result was the Underwood Tariff of 1913, which was the first significant tariff reduction since the Civil War. (Even this tariff provided some protectionist measures, however.)"
32, 6," Sixteenth Amendment—1913","  To replace the revenues from the tariff, the 16th Amendment permitted a federal income tax. The tax originally affected only incomes above $3,000—at that time above middle income. "
32, 7," Federal Reserve Act—1913","  The nation needed credit available outside East Coast financial centers. The nation also needed the currency supply to grow or shrink in response to changing economic conditions. Wilson again appealed successfully over the heads of Congress to the people. The result this time was a decentralized private banking system under federal control.   Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the nation was divided into twelve regions, or districts. Each district had a Federal Reserve bank to which all the national banks within the district belonged. The Fed regulated the amount of currency in circulation by adjusting the interest rate it charged member banks. It could also help struggling member banks by transferring money to them, preventing them from closing."
32, 8," Federal Trade Commission Act—1914","  This act authorized the president to appoint a commission to break monopolies by banning unlawful competition, false advertising, mislabeling or adulterating products, and bribery.  Some of Wilson’s appointees to the commission were pro-business conservatives. Nevertheless, the Wilson administration filed nearly 100 antitrust suits."
32, 9," Clayton Anti-Trust Act—1914","  The Clayton Anti-Trust Act strengthened the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Among other provisions, it banned monopolies.  It also said labor unions were legal and were not subject to antitrust legislation. Strikes, peaceful picketing, boycotts, and the collection of strike benefits were all declared legal. Injunctions were prohibited unless there was ““irreparable injury to property.”“"
32, 10," Keating-Owen Child Labor Act –1916","  The child labor act limited the work hours of children and forbade the interstate sale of goods produced by child labor. Wilson had worked hard for passage of this law. However, in 1918 in Hammer v. Dagenhart, the Supreme Court took a narrow view of interstate commerce and invalidated this law, saying that this was an unconstitutional expansion of federal power. "
32, 11," Federal Farm Loan Act & Warehouse Act—1916","  The Federal Farm Loan Act made low-interest loans available to farmers. The Warehouse Act provided loans to farmers secured by staple crops (corn, cotton, etc.) as collateral."
32, 12," Workingmen’s Compensation Act—1916","  This law provided assistance to disabled federal civil-service employees."
32, 13," Jones Act—1916","  This granted territorial status to the Philippines and promised independence when a stable government was established. Independence was not granted until 1946."
32, 14," Mexican Revolution 1910-1916 & Watchful Waiting ","  Despite calls from American business to intervene in the unsettled situation in Mexico, Wilson refused, backing away from Taft’s dollar diplomacy. He also refused, however, to recognize the government of President Huerta, who had come to power through the murder of his predecessor. Instead Wilson permitted the sale of US weapons to reinforce Huerta’s rivals, Venustiano Carranza and Pancho Villa. This policy of nonrecognition was known as watchful waiting. When a group of American sailors was arrested and Mexico refused to apologize in the manner demanded, Wilson ordered the navy to seize the port of Vera Cruz. But the ABC Powers (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) mediated a resolution of the dispute."
32, 15," Pancho Villa & General John J. Pershing—1916-1917","  In 1914 the Huerta government collapsed and Carranza took power; Wilson reluctantly supported him. Pancho Villa now challenged Carranza for control. To punish the US for its support of Carranza, Villa killed sixteen American mining engineers in northern Mexico. Then he invaded Columbus, New Mexico, and killed nineteen Americans there. Wilson sent Pershing into Mexico to capture Villa. Pershing fought the forces of both Carranza and Villa but did not succeed in his mission.  Pershing’s forces were withdrawn as the approaching war with Germany presented a greater threat."
32, 16," Causes for the Great War","  Nationalism—As ethnic groups that spoke the same languages banded together, they became increasingly nationalistic. The desires for freedom and self-determination were so strong that they were willing to risk war to attain their goals.   Imperialism—The major powers of the world were competing for colonies to add to their empires. Conflict over territories added to the tensions. A System of Alliances—All of these mutual hostilities, jealousies, fears, and desires led the nations of Europe to sign treaties of assistance with one another. There were two main Alliances: The Triple Entente (later known as Allies) and the Central Powers. The members of each alliance vowed to support one another in case of attack.   Militarism—Each nation wanted to keep its armed forces stronger than those of any potential enemy. Competition for international trade led to a naval arms race. The major European countries, as well as the United States and Japan, strengthened their navies to protect their shipping routes.   "
32, 17," Morgan & Loans to the Allied Powers","  British and French orders for munitions and supplies pulled the US economy out of recession. These orders were financed in part by $2.3 billion in loans from J.P. Morgan and other Wall Street bankers. The Germans protested, but these loans and sales did not violate the rules of neutrality. Germany was free to make similar deals, but the British navy made transporting goods to Germany almost impossible."
32, 18," The Difficulties of Submarine Warfare","  Germany argued that submarines were especially vulnerable ships. If they surfaced to give a warning before attacking a merchant ship, they could easily be sunk if the vessel warned was armed as some were."
32, 19," British Blockade","  A British naval blockade had stopped almost all contraband, including food, from reaching Germany. The British actions were illegal under international law. Germany responded with submarine warfare."
32, 20," Lusitania—May 1915","  On May 7, 1915, a German submarine sank the British liner Lusitania off the southern coast of Ireland. Of the 1,198 persons who lost their lives, 128 were Americans. The Germans defended their action on the grounds that the liner was carrying munitions. The Lusitania was carrying munitions, but it was a rule of international law that a passenger ship must be warned before being sunk. Americans on the East Coast, being closer to war, felt that America needed to respond. The rest of the country was not eager to fight."
32, 21," Sussex Ultimatum—March 1916","  After the sinking of the Lusitania and the British ship the Arabic, the US protested so strongly that Germany promised not to sink any more liners without warning. In 1916 Germany broke its pledge and torpedoed an unarmed French passenger steamer, the Sussex. The Sussex did not sink, but about fifty passengers were killed. No Americans were killed but several were injured. Once again the United States warned that it would break off diplomatic relations unless Germany changed its tactics.   Again Germany agreed, in the so-called Sussex pledge, promising that no more merchant ships would be sunk without sufficient warning. But, if the US could not persuade Britain to lift its hunger blockade, Germany would consider itself free to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. "
32, 22," Election of 1916—”“He kept us out of war”“","  Despite the ineffective campaigning of the Republican nominee Charles Evans Hughes, the election was extremely close. Hughes blasted the tariff bill, the attacks on the trusts, and Wilson’s weakness in dealing with Germany and Mexico. Wilson’s campaign featured his success in avoiding war. With strong support from labor and from some Republican progressives, Wilson won narrowly."
32, 23," Neutrality","  Within a week of the outbreak of war in Europe, President Wilson proclaimed US neutrality, a position widely supported. Most Americans, however, were more sympathetic to the side of the Allies, due to cultural and linguistic ties to Britain and to reports of German atrocities. Britain angered the US by choking off American trade with Germany; by 1916 US trade with the Central Powers had dropped to less than 1% of pre-war levels. This interference with America’s neutral rights was reminiscent of the disputes that led to the War of 1812. Meanwhile, in the same period, trade with the Allies nearly quadrupled. But it was Germany’s violations of American neutrality through unrestricted submarine warfare that finally pushed the US into war.  Key ID’s Ch. 33, 1917–1918 "
33, 1," Triple Entente or Allies","  This alliance consisted of France, Britain, and Russia, joined later by the US, Japan, and Italy. Over twenty other smaller nations also joined the Allies."
33, 2," Triple Alliance or Central Powers","  This alliance consisted of Germany and Austria-Hungary, joined later by Turkey and Bulgaria."
33, 3," Gavrilo Princip & Archduke Franz Ferdinand","  In Sarajevo, Bosnia, Gavrilo Princip, a member of the secret society the Black Hand, hoped to unite all Serbs in one nation. He assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. Bosnia was under the control of Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary struck back against the Serbs. Russia ordered its military into action to help the Serbs. The Germans declared war on Russia, and WWI was under way. "
33, 4," Schlieffen Plan","  This was the German plan for victory. It called for a holding action against Russia, which was always slow to mobilize because of its vast size and its shortage of railroads. It was to be combined with a quick attack through the Belgian lowlands to Paris. Then, after France had fallen, the two German armies would unite to defeat Russia. Germany estimated that it would take six weeks to defeat the French and British."
33, 5," Trench Warfare","  The German assault bogged down in France. Both sides dug in, forming a line of trenches stretching across France. Troops in trenches were hard to attack; the line changed little for three years. When one side or the other launched an attack, the death toll was enormous. Overall, 8.5 million soldiers died in the war (about 53,000 Americans)."
33, 6," Zimmermann Note—March 1917","  Alfred Zimmermann, the German foreign secretary, sent a message to the German ambassador in Mexico; British agents intercepted it. It urged Mexico to ally itself with Germany if the US joined the Allied Powers. It said Germany would aid Mexico in recovering Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona if Mexico would enter World War I on the German side and fight against the United States. The note also asked Mexico to urge Japan to join Germany to fight with Germany against the US.  The note aroused great public outrage in the US. This was one of the ““overt acts”“ pushing Wilson to break diplomatic relations with Germany.  "
33, 7," Espionage and Sedition Acts—1917-1918","  The Espionage Act made it a crime to help enemy nations by engaging in spying or sabotage or to interfere with the draft. It also allowed the Postmaster General to control dissent by censoring mail that might be treasonable.  The Sedition Act punished people who criticized the war effort or who spoke disloyally about the Constitution or the federal government. Socialists (most notably Eugene Debs) and labor leaders were the main targets. Six thousand people were arrested; 1,500 convicted. There were outrageous violations of the First Amendment, as when a minister was sentenced to 15 years for telling a Bible study class that a Christian could take no part in the war. "
33, 8," Schenck v. US—1919 ","  Charles Schenck, a socialist, was arrested during WWI and convicted for sending 15,000 anti-draft pamphlets to men scheduled to enter the military service. Schenck called the draft law a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of slavery. It went on to urge draftees not to ““submit to intimidation,”“ but to ““petition for repeal”“ of the draft law. This was the Supreme Court’s first major decision regarding free speech. The Court ruled that Schenck was not protected by the First Amendment because his words presented a ““clear and present danger”“ to the nation. Had this not occurred in a time of war, the Court suggested, Schenck’s words might have been protected."
33, 9," American Expeditionary Force (AEF)","  WWI was the first time US forces send soldiers abroad to defend other countries. These troops were known as the American Expeditionary Force, commanded by General Black Jack Pershing.  AEF troops began to arrive in Europe in June 1917. For the most part, they fought in support of British and French forces rather than as an independent army. Over 4 million Americans fought in Europe with 53,000 killed in action and 234,000 wounded. American soldiers were known as doughboys (for reasons that remain obscure though there is a variety of theories—see http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/origindb.htm )."
33, 10," Industrial Workers of the World","  Led by Big Bill Haywood, the IWW, also known as the Wobblies, were a radical labor group aligned with the socialists. They organized workers who were among the politically least powerful, western miners, loggers, migrant farm workers, etc. The IWW was associated with violence. IWW strikes often became violent, in many cases because management resisted with force. Haywood was at one time tried (but acquitted) for ordering an assassination attempt on the governor of Idaho. During WWI Haywood and ninety-nine other Wobblies were prosecuted for calling a strike in a war industry. Haywood, while out on appeal, fled to Russia."
33, 11," War Industries Board","  This was established in 1917 and reorganized in 1918 under the leadership of Bernard Baruch. The board allocated raw materials, established production priorities, and encouraged standardization. The board established price controls, but only at the wholesale level. As a result, retail prices, as well as corporate profits, soared. The board also encouraged civilians to use substitutes for products containing tin or steel to conserve for the war effort.  "
33, 12," Eighteenth Amendment","  WWI gave the Prohibition movement a significant boost: supporters argued that grain should be used to feed the troops, not to produce alcohol. Further, many brewers were German-Americans and lacked political clout during the war. Other key factors in the success of the amendment were the approval of the Sixteenth Amendment allowing an income tax (previously, the tax on alcohol had been an important source of federal revenue, second only to the tariff) and the growing political power of women (the Nineteenth Amendment was soon to be ratified as well), many of whom supported Prohibition as a way to keep husbands from drinking up the family income. The Eighteenth Amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale, or transportation of alcoholic beverages, but consumption was legal.   During Prohibition drunkenness and alcoholism declined by 50%.  Bootleggers smuggled alcohol from Canada, produced it secretly, and stole it from government warehouses. Bootleggers bribed police and judges, thus creating distrust of public officials and disrespect for the law."
33, 13," Nineteenth Amendment","  During WWI women began to get involved by taking jobs in steel foundries, chemical plants, and munitions factories. They joined the Army Corps of Nurses and went overseas.  These new experiences brought them to believe that they should have the right to vote. This belief was soon shared by many of the men. Further, it seemed absurd to many for the US to be fighting for democracy in Europe while denying democratic rights to women at home.  In 1914 Alice Paul and Lucy Burns formed the National Woman’s party, campaigning with parades, White House demonstrations, and hunger strikes. Wilson finally did endorse their cause.   In 1918 the Anthony amendment was passed in the House.  A year and a half later on August 26, 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, granting women the right to vote. "
33, 14," Fourteen Points","  First were the five points designed to remove what Wilson believed were the causes of war: 1. Open covenants openly arrived at, that is, open diplomacy and no secret treaties. 2. Freedom of the seas. 3. The removal of tariffs and other economic barriers between nations. 4. Arms reduction ““to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.”“ 5. Colonial policies that would take into account the interests of the colonial people as well as the interests of the imperialist powers.   Next were eight points dealing with boundary changes.  These were based on the principle of self-determination.   The fourteenth point called for the formation of a League of Nations to keep world peace. "
33, 15," Results of the Treaty of Versailles","  Nine new nations emerged, and the boundaries of the other nations were shifted.  Some areas were carved out of German or Turkish territory or colonial possessions and given to one or another of the allies as mandates.  A mandate, or temporary colony, was to be administered by the victorious Allied country until the area was ready for self-rule and then independence. The German military was drastically reduced, and Germany was required to pay $32 billion in reparations. Germany protested the harsh conditions, but the Allies threatened to resume war if Germany did not sign."
33, 16," Weaknesses of the Treaty of Versailles","  It failed to establish any sort of lasting peace. The first problem area was Germany. The treaty contained a war-guilt clause under which Germany acknowledged that it alone was responsible for World War I. The result of the war-guilt clause and the loss of the Saar was that Germans of all political viewpoints hated the treaty. German pride was also insulted because, when Austria-Hungary was split up, three million German-speaking people were placed in an area of northern Czechoslovakia known as the Sudetenland.   The second problem was Russia. Russia had lost much territory—some to Poland, some to Romania, and some to the four new Baltic nations of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. These Baltic nations were created to serve as a buffer zone against the spread of communism. The result was the USSR sought to regain as much lost territory as possible.  The third area was Southeast Asia. The problem was with what the treaty left out. Ho Chi Minh wanted a constitutional government for Vietnam that would give the Vietnamese people the same civil and political rights as the French. Wilson abruptly rejected this request. "
33, 17," Irreconcilables","  This was the name given to a dozen senators who were staunch isolationists who saw the League of Nations as dangerous superstate. Led by William Borah of Idaho and Hiram Johnson of California, they were firmly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles. Wilson made his task harder by ignoring moderate senators during negotiation of the treaty and refusing to consider modifications requested by the Senate."
33, 18," League of Nations","  The League was a voluntary association of sovereign nations. Although it was intended to preserve international peace by giving nations a forum for working out their differences, it had little hope of doing so.  Each member nation retained full sovereignty, controlled its own military, and determined its own foreign policy. The League lacked real enforcement power. It could recommend but not enforce sanctions on aggressors."
33, 19," Big Four","  The Big Four were the leaders of the US, France, Britain, and Italy, the victors in WWI. The European leaders did not share Wilson’s idealism. France, led by Georges Clemenceau, wanted to prevent another invasion from Germany. Germany had invaded France in 1870 as well as in WWI. Britain was led by David Lloyd George who had just won election on the platform of making Germany pay reparations.  Italy, led by Vittorio Orlando, hoped to obtain Austrian territory.  "
33, 20," Normalcy","  Following the end of WWI, America retreated from two decades of idealism and reform. The country had entered WWI, hoping this would be a ““war to end all wars,”“ to ““make the world safe for democracy.”“ Clearly, that was not to be. In the 1920 campaign, Republican Warren G. Harding promised a disillusioned and weary nation a ““return to normalcy,”“ a respite from idealism. Key ID’s Ch. 34, 1919-1929 "
34, 1," Hysteria of the Red Scare","  In 1919, there were communist attempts to overthrow the governments of Germany and Hungary. Also in 1919 the Third Communist International met in Moscow, advocating worldwide revolution to overthrow capitalism.  The US socialist movement was splintered and weak, but many in the US saw socialism and labor unions as part of an international communist conspiracy. "
34, 2," Strikes After WWI","  Few strikes had taken place during WWI, but after the war, there were many strikes as workers tried to force employers to raise wages to catch up with increased prices. There were 3,000 strikes in 1919 including a general strike in Seattle that, though orderly, led the mayor to call for federal troops to head off the communist menace.  Employers and newspapers argued that unions were planning communist revolution. Some unions were, but employers often manufactured charges of communism to discredit unions, break strikes, and hold down wages."
34, 3," Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer","  In 1919 bombs were mailed to a number of business and government leaders including J.P. Morgan and John Rockefeller; almost all were intercepted by the Post Office. A hand-delivered bomb exploded at Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer’s front gate. Bombings and violence hit a number of cities. Leaflets signed ““The Anarchist Fighters”“ were found at bombing sites. Palmer raided the offices of anarchists, socialists, and communists, often without search warrants. Suspects were often denied lawyers. Many detainees were simply friends of suspicious persons. Palmer deported 249 aliens.   In January 1920 6,000 were arrested in a series of raids. Arrests were often based on little more than suspicion and were conducted without warrants. The accused were generally deprived of due process. Palmer also predicted riots and violence on May Day 1920. It didn’t happen, and people lost interest in Palmer’s crusade."
34, 4," Sacco & Vanzetti Case","  Sacco and Vanzetti were anarchists who avoided the draft during WWI. In 1920, they were arrested in a payroll robbery in which two men were killed. They were found guilty and sentenced to death, and the state supreme court refused to give them a new trial. The execution was postponed while a committee of three citizens reexamined the case.  Although later studies dispute the guilt of Sacco and Vanzetti, they were convicted in an unfair trial. Their judge, for example, referred to them privately as ““those anarchist bastards.”“ Very little solid evidence against them was presented at their trial. But the fact that they were immigrants and anarchists and that the country was in the middle of the Red Scare was enough to convict them. The conviction was upheld. They were electrocuted in 1927. "
34, 5," The Great Migration","  The Great Migration was a mass movement of African Americans from the rural South primarily to the industrial North beginning around the time of World War I. Seeking jobs in Northern cities and an escape from de jure racism (discrimination sanctioned by law), over one million blacks left the South by 1919. The Great Migration was one factor leading to the Harlem Renaissance. (See below.) At times, this huge influx of newcomers led to tensions with Northern whites. White workers especially resented blacks hired as scabs or strikebreakers. Racial tensions erupted in the summer of 1919; there were twenty-six race riots across the country. More than one hundred blacks were killed, and thousands were wounded or left homeless."
34, 6," The New Ku Klux Klan—1915-1929","  In 1915 the KKK was revived. Several hundred thousand blacks had moved north in the Great Migration to take jobs in wartime industries. In addition, blacks who had served in the military during WWI were increasingly likely to demand their democratic rights.     KKK peak membership was reached in 1924 with 4.5 million members. It focused not simply on keeping blacks in their place, but also repressing Catholics, Jews, and foreigners. It enforced Prohibition and opposed union organizers.   Grand Wizard Hiram Evans claimed the Klan members felt threatened by the changes in American society and their moral values were being attacked. Job competition between immigrants increased their fears. (The Klan was also very powerful in Oregon, primarily targeting Catholics. The Gazette-Times was the first newspaper in Oregon to speak out against the KKK.)"
34, 7," Emergency Quota Act of 1921 ","  This limited the yearly number of immigrants from each nation to 3% of the foreign-born persons from that nation living in the US in 1910. The law tended to favor immigrants from southern and eastern Europe since huge numbers from those countries had arrived by 1910. "
34, 8," Immigration Act of 1924","  This law cut quotas from 3% to 2% and shifted the base year from 1910 to 1890. This effectively cut back on immigration from eastern and southern Europe (the new immigrants). In addition, the Immigration Act of 1924 completely blocked immigration from Japan. Immigration from Canada and Latin America was not limited."
34, 9," Immigration Act of 1929  ","  Also known as the National Origins Plan, this capped immigration at 150,000 per year, imposed a quota for each country based on the number of people having that national origin in 1920, and banned all immigration from Asian nations. Again immigration from Canada and Latin America was not limited. These three acts all were efforts to restrict immigration and maintain America’s ethnic and racial composition. They marked an end to the era of almost unlimited immigration. "
34, 10," Volstead Act—1919","  This law implemented the Eighteenth Amendment, Prohibition, also known as the Noble Experiment."
34, 11," Speakeasies","  These were illegal bars serving alcohol during Prohibition."
34, 12," The Lindbergh Law—1932","  This made interstate kidnapping a death penalty offense after Charles Lindbergh’s son was kidnapped for ransom and eventually murdered. The trial of the kidnappers was that decade’s ““trial of the century.”“"
34, 13," John Dewey","  Dewey was a leading philosopher. He also was an educational reformer who advocated progressive education (more permissive than previous practices) and ““learning by doing.”“ Dewey thought democratic education could lead to an improved democratic society."
34, 14," Scopes Monkey Trial—1925","  John Scopes taught high school biology in Dayton, Tennessee, using a book that presented Darwin’s view of evolution. A state law forbade the teaching of evolution in Tennessee. Scopes agreed to serve as a test case. He had been teaching out of the only state-approved biology text in Tennessee, but he later said he could not remember if he had actually talked about evolution in his classroom. The city fathers of Dayton thought the trial would be a good opportunity to bring visitors and tourist dollars to Dayton.  Clarence Darrow was Scopes’ defense lawyer appointed by the ACLU.  William Jennings Bryan led the prosecution. After Scopes was found guilty and fined, the Tennessee Supreme Court dismissed the case on a technicality.  The trial was an example of the cultural divide between rural and urban America."
34, 15," Henry Ford ","  Though Henry Ford did not invent the assembly line, he applied it to auto manufacturing where it helped him lower the price of cars to the point where many in the working class could afford his Model T. Ford also was known for raising wages to $5 a day, more than double the going rate. He did this to limit turnover on the assembly line where as many as 60% of the workers had been quitting every year due to the fast pace of the work."
34, 16," Advertising & Consumers","  American manufacturers became concerned about their ability to sell all they could produce. Advertising was one response to this. Americans were encouraged to see themselves as consumers rather than as citizens, to be perpetually dissatisfied with their possessions.  Buying on credit and planned obsolescence (making products with an intentionally limited life span and bringing out ““new, improved”“ models every year) were two techniques to encourage increased purchasing. Bruce Barton, a leading advertising executive, applied advertising concepts to religion. His book about the life of Christ, The Man Nobody Knows, argued that Christ was a terrific ad man."
34, 17," Impact of the Automobile ","  By the late 1920’s more Americans owned cars than owned bathtubs. This brought significant social changes. The auto industry stimulated the steel, petroleum, rubber, and glass industries while railroads languished.  Road construction boomed and Americans increasingly moved to suburbs. Family life changed as people moved away from home. The car smashed old courtship patterns; one conservative condemned the auto as ““a house of prostitution on wheels.”“ "
34, 18," Charles A. Lindbergh’s Spirit of St. Louis —1927","  Although other pilots had crossed the ocean, Lindbergh was the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic. A genuinely modest person who displayed traditional virtues, Lindbergh was the subject of perhaps the most intense hero worship since George Washington."
34, 19," Radio","  The 1920’s brought commercial radio into many American homes. Unlike the auto that pulled families apart, radio brought people back into the living room. Radio also served to expose the entire nation to the same entertainment, news, and advertisements. It served to homogenize the culture."
34, 20," The Jazz Singer—1927","  This was the first feature-length talkie, a motion picture with sound. It starred Al Jolson, a white man wearing blackface."
34, 21," Will C. Hays & the Movie Code","  Another area that revealed the tension between traditional and modern culture was the movies. Appalled by nudity and sexuality in early films, conservatives pressured the movie industry to change. In 1930 film studios adopted a code, known as the Hays Code for the person who enforced it, that banned a long list of morally inappropriate actions. For example, excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, and suggestive postures were forbidden. The Hays code stayed in effect until 1966.  "
34, 22," Census of 1920","  In 1920, more Americans for the first time lived not in the country, but in urban areas. This geographic fact also represents the tension between traditional and modern culture in the 1920’s. "
34, 23," Flappers","  A flapper was a young modern woman who went on dates without a chaperone, wore fashionable clothes, wore make-up, and perhaps smoked cigarettes. Another symbol of cultural tension in the 1920’s. "
34, 24," Sigmund Freud","  A Viennese physician and psychologist, Freud argued that sexual repression caused a variety of nervous and emotional ills.  His theories were used to justify the new sexual liberation.  "
34, 25," Margaret Sanger","  Sanger was a crusader for birth control and family planning. In 1916 she opened the first family-planning clinic in the US. She was often jailed for her actions and words. Another symbol of cultural tension in the 1920’s.  "
34, 26," Jazz","  This distinctively American musical form became widely popular in the 1920’s. It was condemned for its reliance on improvisation (civilization demands that one follow rules), its African-American origins, and its effect on the morals of those who listened and danced to it. Another symbol of cultural tension in the 1920’s.  "
34, 27," Willa Cather","  A prominent novelist in the 1920’s, Cather wrote books with strong female characters (My Antonia). She criticized the growing mechanization and mass-produced quality of American society. "
34, 28," H. L. Mencken","  Mencken edited the literary journals the Smart Set and the American Mercury.  He promoted writers of talent and mercilessly attacked hack writers, pretension, provincialism, and prudery. Mencken blasted organized religion, business, and the middle class (what he called the booboisie).    "
34, 29," F. Scott Fitzgerald","  One of a promising generation of young writers, Fitzgerald’s books described the life of modern young people during the Jazz Age (This Side of Paradise, The Great Gatsby)."
34, 30," Ernest Hemingway","  Hemingway, a member of the Lost Generation who left America for Paris, wrote with weary disillusionment about war (A Farewell to Arms). He was known for his view that one must respond to the trials of life with grace under pressure (The Old Man and the Sea)."
34, 31," Sinclair Lewis","  Lewis attacked many aspects of American life in the 1920’s: small-town provincialism (Main Street), middle-class materialism (Babbitt), and religious hypocrisy (Elmer Gantry)"
34, 32," Harlem Renaissance","  The Great Migration of blacks to Northern cities helped to spark the Harlem Renaissance, a burst of intellectual and cultural creativity. Not all of the best work was done in Harlem.  Writers James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, and Countee Cullen, actors such as Paul Robeson, musicians Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Bessie Smith, Cab Calloway, and others enriched American culture. "
34, 33," Frank Lloyd Wright","  Wright sought to create a distinctly American architecture, one that did not follow Greek and Roman models. He advocated ““organic architecture”“ that was in harmony with its setting and based on natural forms. His best-known example was Fallingwater, a house built astride a waterfall in Pennsylvania. Key ID’s Ch. 35, 1920-1932 "
35, 1," Adkins v. Children’s Hospital —1923","  This case overturned the Muller v. Oregon decision. In Adkins, the Supreme Court ruled that women were not entitled to special protection in the workplace and that a minimum-wage law for women was unconstitutional. The Court’s ruling was based on the fact that the Nineteenth Amendment had granted women the right to vote. As the legal equals of men, they could not receive preferential treatment."
35, 2," The American Legion—1919","  The American Legion was in part a social club, but it was more significant as a lobbying organization pressuring Congress for benefits for veterans. The American Legion was also noted as a force opposed to what it saw as radical or socialist groups such as the IWW."
35, 3," Washington Disarmament Conference—1921-1922","  At this conference Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes proposed a halt to the naval arms race. Several agreements were signed.  The Five Power Treaty set limits for battleships and aircraft carriers in the following ratios—5 (US & Britain): 3 (Japan): 1.75 (Italy & France). In addition, the nations agreed to halt battleship construction for ten years. Britain and the US agreed to refrain from fortifying their Far East possessions (as compensation to the Japanese). The Four Power Treaty obligated the US, Britain, Japan, and France to respect each other’s territorial possessions in the Pacific and to refer any disputes among them to a conference for negotiation. "
35, 4," The Kellogg-Briand Pact (Pact of Paris)—1928","  In this agreement, the US and sixty-one other nations pledged to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. The only problem was that, except for the pressure of world opinion, there was no way to enforce it."
35, 5," Fordney-McCumber Tariff—1922","  This raised tariffs from an average of 27% under Wilson’s Underwood Tariff to an average of 38.5%.  It also allowed the president, with the advice of a tariff commission, to raise or lower rates on specific products. Harding and Coolidge raised rates thirty-two times in six years but lowered rates in only five cases. As a result, Europeans found it harder to sell goods to the US to earn the dollars needed to pay back their war debts. In addition, Europeans raised tariff rates to protect their own industries, cutting sales of US goods. "
35, 6," Teapot Dome & Elk Hills scandals—1921","  There were several scandals involving President Harding’s friends. Teapot Dome was the worst. Progressives had pressed for conservation of resources; oil fields at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and at Elk Hills, California, had been set aside for use by the Navy. Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall secretly leased the land to two private oil companies. Fall soon received $325,000 and a large herd of cattle. Fall was convicted of bribery and sent to prison. The oil company executives went free. The oil reserves were returned to government control. In an unrelated scandal, Harding’s Attorney General Harry Daugherty was prosecuted but not convicted for the illegal sale of pardons and liquor permits."
35, 7," The McNary-Haugen Bill—1924-1928","  With the end of WWI, prices for farm crops dropped. At the same time, farmers were expanding production, thanks to the replacement of mules with tractors, driving prices still lower. As a result, one in four farms was sold to cover mortgages or taxes.   The McNary-Haugen Bill called for the federal government to buy extra wheat, corn, cotton, and tobacco at a fair price, setting a minimum price above the world market price. A special tax would be placed on farm crops. Farmers would lose something by paying the tax, but on balance they would be better off. President Coolidge vetoed the bill as an unconstitutional use of federal power every time Congress passed it from 1924-1928. "
35, 8," War Debts and the Dawes Plan—1924","  The Allies owed the US huge debts from the war. Britain owed $4 billion and France $3.5 billion. Germany owed Britain and France $32 billion in reparations. With German economy in tatters, the Allies weren’t receiving their reparations and were having trouble paying their own debts. The Dawes Plan had US banks lend money to Germany. Germany then paid reparations to the Allies who made payments on their war debts to the US Treasury.  When the Depression struck, US bankers could afford no more loans to Germany. The Allies, except for Finland, defaulted on their loans."
35, 9," Presidential Election of 1928  ","  The Democrats nominated New York Governor Al Smith, a Catholic and an opponent of Prohibition. Smith’s religion and his New York accent hurt him with rural and conservative voters. The Republicans nominated Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover, a skilled administrator who attacked socialism and praised rugged individualism. Hoover won easily."
35, 10," The Agricultural Marketing Act—1929","  To help farmers help themselves, Hoover supported the Agricultural Marketing Act. It lent money to help farm cooperatives buy, sell, and store surplus crops when prices sank below a certain level. It proved inadequate for dealing with the farm problems of the Depression."
35, 11," Hawley-Smoot Tariff—1930","  This was the highest protective tariff in America’s peacetime history, raising rates to 60%. It reduced trade with Europe as European nations retaliated."
35, 12," Bull & Bear Market","  A bull market is one with rising prices; a bear market, the opposite. Through the 1920’s, a strong bull market led to a quadrupling of stock prices."
35, 13," Black Tuesday—Oct. 29, 1929","  In late October, stocks began a precipitous plunge. By mid-November, stocks had lost two-thirds of their value. Fortunes disappeared overnight. The stock market collapse did not cause the Depression. But it did shake the confidence of the country and lead people to spend less, reducing demand and deepening the Depression."
35, 14," Causes of the Great Depression","  Overcapacity—Industry could produce more goods than people wanted or could afford. Mechanization—Technological developments meant more goods could be produced with fewer workers. Productivity per worker rose 30% during the 1920’s. This led to layoffs; unemployed workers could not buy goods to stimulate the economy. Unequal distribution of income—In 1929, the richest 5% of the country received 33% of the nation’s income. Seventy-one percent of farmers lived below the poverty level before the Depression started. Those who wanted to buy goods could not afford to do so. Easy credit—Consumers accumulated huge debts during the 1920’s, often using stocks as collateral. With the collapse of the stock market, the collateral was insufficient, leading banks to collapse. Unbalanced foreign trade—The Hawley-Smoot Tariff made it harder to sell goods to Europe since Europeans could not sell goods to the US and earn the dollars needed to buy American products. No social safety net— There was no federal welfare system in the 1920’s, no unemployment insurance, no Social Security. American society was dominated by a philosophy of rugged individualism which said people should take care of themselves during hard times, get along without government assistance, and pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.   "
35, 15," President Hoover’s approach to the Depression:  ","  Hoover tried to restore confidence in the economy by asking business not to cut payrolls and labor not to ask for higher wages. Most of them initially agreed, at least until 1931. He cut taxes and pressed the Federal Reserve Board to cut interest rates to make borrowing easier. He procured $2 billion for public works projects. He established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Home Loan Bank Act to assist businesses and head off some foreclosures.  But he was a fiscal conservative who said we couldn’t ““squander our way to prosperity,”“ and so he opposed further spending plans."
35, 16," Hoover’s Rugged Individualism","  Hoover was considered a humanitarian, always wanting to help others. He first became prominent as the WWI head of the Belgian Relief Commission. Believing in rugged individualism, he thought that individuals and local government agencies were the ones to care for children, sick, old, and disabled. Direct handouts would decrease a person’s self-respect. He believed the depression could come to an end with individual initiative and private charity.    Hoover did more than any previous president had to end a depression. He lent money to the states and millions to corporations to help them resume productivity; it wasn’t enough. "
35, 17," Hoovervilles","  The unemployed and homeless didn’t understand why federal money was not directed to help them and blamed President Hoover. The Democratic National Committee began to damage Hoover’s image more. Groups of shacks in which the homeless lived became known as Hoovervilles. Old newspapers used for warmth were called Hoover blankets, and empty pockets turned inside out were called Hoover flags. Jackrabbits were Hoover steers.   "
35, 18," Muscle Shoals Bill","  This was a predecessor to Franklin Roosevelt’s TVA. Hoover vetoed it as socialistic."
35, 19," Reconstruction Finance Corporation—1932","  The RFC was started by Hoover to make loans to industries such as banks, life insurance companies, and railroads in hopes of getting them back on their feet.   The RFC was criticized as a trickle-down or ““horse and sparrow”“ approach because it gave money not to the poor but to businesses in hopes that the benefits would trickle down to the jobless. However, it was a limited success in sustaining some businesses."
35, 20," Norris-La Guardia Act—1932","  This pro-labor bill outlawed yellow-dog contracts and forbade injunctions banning strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing. Hoover signed it."
35, 21," Bonus Army—1932","  In 1924 Congress voted to pay WWI veterans a cash bonus in 1945 to make up for the amount of money the men lost while fighting in the war. At the start of the Depression, they were permitted to take out some of their bonus money. The next year they asked for full payment. The marchers of the Bonus Army began in Oregon and headed for Washington, D.C., hoping to gain the support of others on the Patman Bill, which would provide full payment. By early June, there were 17,000 veterans and their families in Washington D.C. The Senate voted down the bill on June 17. The veterans were offered money for a ride home, which would be taken out of their bonus. Two thousand remained and were driven out on July 28. Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur and Major Dwight D. Eisenhower led US troops against the Bonus Marchers. Two Bonus Marchers died in the fight, one thousand people were attacked with tear gas, killing a baby. The Hoover administration published reports that most of the Bonus Marchers were communists or criminals, but investigations did not support those charges. The administration appeared callous and blundering in its handling of the Marchers."
35, 22," Japanese in Manchuria—1931","  Japan invaded China and took control of the province of Manchuria. The US refused to cooperate with a League of Nations economic boycott of Japan. Instead the US issued the Stimson Doctrine, saying that the US would recognize no seizure of territory by force. Japan stayed in Manchuria."
35, 23," Hoover and Latin America","  Hoover sought to make US policy in Latin America less interventionist. He withdrew US marines from Haiti and Nicaragua and did not intervene in several rebellions. Franklin Roosevelt is generally credited with implementing the Good Neighbor policy. But Hoover began the policy four years earlier. Key ID’s Ch. 36, 1933 – 1938 "
36, 1," Eleanor Roosevelt ","  In 1921 FDR contracted polio, leaving his legs paralyzed. But with the aid of his wife Eleanor, he continued a career in politics.    Eleanor traveled in place of her husband on campaign trips and on fact-finding missions, bringing her husband first-hand reports of the conditions people faced. She became an articulate voice on behalf of the poor and minorities and helped push FDR in a more liberal direction."
36, 2," FDR’s Brain Trust","  During the campaign, FDR had been vague about his promised New Deal. While working on the New Deal, Roosevelt’s advisers met in New York to discuss economic and social programs. Three Columbia University professors, Adolf A. Berle, Raymond Moley, and Rexford G. Tugwell, were present as well. Newspapers began referring to this group as the Brain Trust. They had formed ideas for Roosevelt’s campaign speeches and later wrote much of the New Deal legislation."
36, 3," African Americans & the New Deal Coalition","  Since Lincoln and Emancipation, blacks had supported the Republicans. But they were hit harder than other groups by the Depression. Although the New Deal was not colorblind, it did provide relief to blacks. Eleanor Roosevelt was an eloquent advocate for minorities. And FDR had a group of unofficial black advisors, the Black Cabinet, to make sure that issues important to African Americans were raised. As a result, African Americans moved solidly into the Democratic Party, giving the Democrats 80% or more of their votes in many elections. In addition to African Americans, FDR’s New Deal coalition included the poor, union members, and ethnic and religious minorities (many of them the so-called New Immigrants), and white Southerners. This New Deal coalition allowed the Democrats to dominate national politics until the late 1960’s."
36, 4," Mass Deportations—1929-1939","  As unemployment grew, the Hoover administration and later the Roosevelt administration deported perhaps as many as two million Mexican Americans, of whom 60% were US citizens. Many of the rest were in the country legally, having been recruited by companies such as Ford Motors to provide much needed labor during the boom years of the 1920’s.  Known as the Repatriation, this involved raids and arrests carried out by the Immigration and Naturalization Service often without warrants and due process. A government commission that later investigated the deportations called the process ““unconstitutional, tyrannic and oppressive.”“"
36, 5," The Hundred Days","  In the first one hundred days of FDR’s administration, Congress passed over a dozen major New Deal measures, including the FERA, CCC, AAA, TVA, and NIRA. The effect of this flood of legislation was to give the public a sense that action to combat the Depression was being taken. In addition, these measures set the precedent for increased federal intervention in the economy."
36, 6," Relief, Recovery, & Reform","  The New Deal had several goals. In the short term, the goals were to provide relief (assistance to the poor and unemployed) and immediate recovery (improved performance in the economy). In the long term, the goals were permanent recovery and reform of the economic system (to allow the capitalist system to function more reliably). Examples: Relief—CCC, FERA. Recovery—bank holiday, AAA. Reform—SEC, Glass-Steagall Act."
36, 7," The New Deal and 20th Century Liberalism","  Although FDR was not a systematic political thinker, his New Deal policies, combined with Harry Truman’s later Cold War policies, formed the basis of liberalism in the 20th century. Classical liberalism supported change, was optimistic about progress, and favored giving people (and businesses) more freedom. Twentieth century liberalism retained the optimism about progress and combined it with a faith in government to bring about that progress.  Specifically, 20th century liberalism saw government as having responsibility for managing the economy (a move away from the laissez-faire economics of classical liberalism) and for providing citizens with an economic safety net (sometimes referred to as a limited welfare state). During the Cold War, liberalism added vigorous anti-communism to its beliefs."
36, 8," Emergency Banking Relief Act (Bank Holiday)—1933","  In the first three years of the Depression, 5100 banks failed. In the first three months before FDR’s inauguration, an addition 4000 banks failed. Two days after FDR’s inauguration, he ordered a bank holiday to halt bank collapses as depositors withdrew their money in panic.   Congress met in a special session on March 9 to hear the terms of FDR’s Emergency Banking Relief Bill. It passed in eight hours and, by the end of the day, was signed into law. It gave the Treasury Department authorization to inspect the country’s banks. The sound banks could open at once, the ones that needed help received loans, and insolvent ones were forced to remain closed. About 10% of all banks stayed closed."
36, 9," Fireside Chats ","  After the bank holiday, FDR addressed the nation on radio, explaining how the banking system worked in simple language. This was the first fireside chat, FDR’s method of explaining New Deal policy in homey metaphors.   "
36, 10," Glass-Steagall Banking Reform Act—1933","  The Glass-Steagall Act started the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This protected bank deposits up to $5,000, and as a result, depositors didn’t have to worry about losing their savings.  This act also limited risky speculation by banks through separating commercial and investment banking. In other words, banks were forbidden from taking people’s deposits and speculating in the stock market with that money. "
36, 11," Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)—1933","  The Civilian Conservation Corps hired unemployed single males ages seventeen to twenty to work on building roads, planting trees, and helping with soil-erosion and flood control. They lived in camps run by army officers and were directed by foresters and construction foremen. Twenty-five of the thirty dollars they earned each month was sent to their families. They got free food and uniforms.  Within eight years, the CCC had planted over 200 million trees, built hundreds of miles of trails, and fought dozens of forest fires. By 1941, close to 3 million men had gone through the CCC. "
36, 12," Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA)—1933","  The FERA, run by Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, gave an initial $250 million to the states in order to feed and clothe the unemployed, the elderly, and the sick. The FERA provided an additional $250 million, given on the basis of one federal dollar for every three state dollars contributed. It provided direct relief to the needy and paid wages for federal work projects."
36, 13," Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC)","  This program provided assistance to nonfarm homeowners who were struggling to meet mortgage payments as well as to banks who held these mortgages. It enabled homeowners to refinance their mortgages."
36, 14," Huey Long ","  Considered by FDR to be the most dangerous foe of the New Deal, Long started out as a poor salesman of patent medicines. After studying law he began to fight the oil and utility companies that controlled the state. A great speaker, he was elected governor in 1928, giving Louisiana schools, roads, bridges, and hospitals. Long’s administration in Louisiana was marked by corruption and political repression, however. In 1930 he became a senator.   Called the Kingfish, Long began to consider the presidency. He started Share the Wealth in 1934, with the motto ““Every Man a King.”“ It was supposed to guarantee $5,000 a year income for every family in the United States by taking over the wealth of millionaires and dividing the nation’s land and mineral treasures. Every family should own a house, an automobile, and a radio.   Long was shot to death in the state capitol in Baton Rouge in 1935.  "
36, 15," Father Charles Coughlin and Dr. Francis Townshend—New Deal Critics","  Coughlin, a priest in Detroit, broadcast his sermons. At first, Coughlin was a staunch supporter of the 1932 presidential candidate FDR, campaigning in support of FDR on his radio broadcast. Coughlin was vehemently against Wall Street, and he warned his audience of the evils of capitalism.  However, dissatisfied with the slow moving monetary reform of FDR’s New Deal, Coughlin declared the New Deal a communist conspiracy. He proceeded to use his radio sermons as a political forum in which to attack President Roosevelt. After 1936, his talks combined harsh attacks on Roosevelt as the tool of international Jewish bankers with praise for the fascist leaders Mussolini and Hitler, leading to his political demise. Townshend, a retired physician, advocated providing the elderly with federal pensions. The plan applied to Americans over sixty who retired (freeing jobs for younger workers); they would receive a monthly check for $200 (a significant sum at the time), but that check had to be spent within one month, thus pumping money into the economy. However, this program would have consumed as much as half the national budget. Although Townshend’s proposal was not enacted, it helped to build support for FDR’s Social Security plan. "
36, 16," Works Progress Administration (WPA)—1935","  The Works Progress Administration headed by Harry Hopkins was to provide as many jobs as fast as possible. It received a budget of $5 billion, the largest amount any country had ever spent on public welfare. Between 1935 and 1941 8 million persons were employed.   Workers built or repaired 651,000 miles of roads and constructed 110,000 libraries, schools, and hospitals. Women sewed 300 million garments for the needy. The WPA found work for unemployed artists, musicians, and actors, by presenting free public concerts to make the artists known.  A notable project funded by the WPA was the Federal Writers’ Project. It was intended to employ writers, historians, teachers, and librarians. The Federal Writers’ Project is best known for creating a series of historical and cultural guidebooks for each state and for recording the oral histories of over 2,000 former slaves. The WPA was criticized for encouraging people to vote Democratic in exchange for handouts, for boondoggles or make-work jobs, and because 20 percent of the funds went to the arts instead of construction.  "
36, 17," National Recovery Administration (NRA) (Blue Eagle)—1933","  The National Industrial Recovery Act created the National Recovery Administration. The NRA called for codes detailing fair practices for industry. Each industry was to set up its code. If it didn’t, the NRA would do so. Industries operating under such an NRA code were exempt from anti-trust action. This was done in hopes of limiting production so prices would go up, thus producing a profit. In addition, minimum wages and maximum work hours were set. Child labor was abolished. Small businesses and consumers argued that the codes favored big business.  The NIRA was declared unconstitutional in the 1935 Schechter Poultry case."
36, 18," Schechter v. US —1935","  In what was known as the ““sick chicken case,”“ a poultry corporation supposedly sold an unfit chicken to a butcher. The Supreme Court ruled NIRA unconstitutional, saying that it gave legislative powers to the executive branch and that some of the industry codes covered intrastate commerce.  The decision indicated that the Court saw activities such as mining, construction, manufacturing, and agriculture as essentially local and out of the control of the federal government."
36, 19," Public Works Administration (PWA)—1933","  The NIRA also set up the Public Works Administration, which was to engage in pump priming through funding major construction projects such as dams, hospitals, and airports."
36, 20," Twentieth Amendment (Lame Duck)—1933 ","  FDR was elected in November of 1932 but did not take office until March of 1933. During that time he was reluctant to work with Hoover on economic policies. The Twentieth Amendment moved up the dates to January for the new president and Congress to take office, reducing the lame duck period."
36, 21," Twenty-First Amendment—1933","  This repealed prohibition. Prior to its repeal, FDR endorsed and Congress approved a law allowing the sale of beer and wine."
36, 22," Agriculture Adjustment Act (AAA)—1933","  Net farm income per farmer had dropped from $162 in 1929 to $48 in 1932. Farmers’ purchasing power had fallen 60% since farm prices dropped faster than industrial prices. The nation was beginning to see mob violence from angry farmers, and the National Guard had been called out in some states to put counties under martial law.  The Agricultural Adjustment Administration sought to reduce oversupply of farm commodities. It offered to pay farmers a certain amount for each acre left unplanted. The government paid cotton farmers $200 million to plow under 10 million acres of their crop and also paid hog farmers to slaughter 6 million swine. To pay for these subsidies, the government imposed a tax on the processors of agricultural products (for example, on mills that ground wheat into flour). Many were upset about the waste of food while so many Americans were going hungry.  The Supreme Court struck down the AAA, saying that its taxing provisions were unconstitutional because the AAA taxed one group of society (processors) to benefit a second group (farmers). (The Second AAA was passed in 1938. It was funded out of general tax revenues and was therefore found to be constitutional.)"
36, 23," Soil Conservation & Domestic Allotment Act—1936","  The Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act instead paid farmers to reduce their acreage by planting soil-conserving crops or by letting their land lie fallow."
36, 24," Dust Bowl","  A severe drought combined with high temperatures and poor farming practices led to severe erosion in the Midwest. Hundreds of thousands of farmers lost their land and migrated west."
36, 25," Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)—1934","  This was established to prevent insider trading and manipulation of stock prices. Joseph Kennedy (the father of President Kennedy) was put in charge of the new SEC.  While at first some people objected, they began to see the need for regulation after Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange, was put in prison for dishonest financial practices."
36, 26," Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)—1933","  Since WWI Congress had been arguing what to do about the hydroelectric plants the government had built in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, along the Tennessee River, to produce explosive nitrates. After the war, private utility companies wanted to buy or lease the plants. Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska headed a group of congressmen who believed that the federal government should continue to develop the natural resources.   In 1933, the TVA was started, originally to set an example of regional economic planning. FDR wanted to try a coordinated system of economic development instead of a group of separate and unrelated reforms. The TVA brought new factories, new energy, and new jobs to one of the nation’s poorest regions. Prior to the TVA, only 2% of the farms in the region had electricity.  The TVA encouraged grassroots participation and was successful in doing so. But it was racially segregated. Only whites could help in the planning, and only whites shared in the benefits."
36, 27," Federal Housing Administration (FHA)—1934","  One of the longest lasting New Deal programs, the FHA provided loans for new home construction or remodels."
36, 28," Social Security Act—1935","  In 1935 Congress passed the Social Security Act, providing a pension system for retired workers and their spouses and death benefits for children up to the age of eighteen. The pensions were not based on financial need. Farm workers and domestics were not covered.   This is believed to have affected the lives of more people than any other legislation passed in the New Deal. (Other industrialized nations had already created such programs a generation or more before.) "
36, 29," National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act)—1935","  This bill was sponsored by Senator Robert F. Wagner to replace the labor provisions of the now-unconstitutional NIRA.  The NLRA gave workers a number of important rights. Employers were required to engage in collective bargaining with their workers. The law banned unfair practices, including threatening workers for union activity, firing union members, and interfering with union activities. It set up the National Labor Relations Board to hear testimony about unfair labor practices and to supervise elections where workers indicated whether they wanted to be represented by a union. "
36, 30," Congress for Industrial Organization (CIO)—1935","  Originally the Committee for Industrial Organization, this group led by John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers organized unskilled workers. The parent organization AFL had traditionally focused on skilled workers.  The CIO, using the sit-down strike, a tactic where striking workers refused to leave the factory to prevent the importation of strikebreakers, successfully organized the auto industry.  In 1938 the CIO broke away from the AFL."
36, 31," Fair Labor Standards Act (Wages and Hours Bill)—1938","  This replaced the part of the NIRA that dealt with wages and hours. It established the first national minimum hourly rate for wages (25¢/hour at first, moving up to 40¢ in two years), a national maximum work week (44 hours/week moving to 40 hours in two years), and a ban on factory work by workers under sixteen. "
36, 32," The Election of 1936","  Roosevelt was opposed by Kansas Governor Alf Landon, who supported many of the New Deal programs (though not Social Security). The Republican Party platform condemned the New Deal for its radicalism, confusion, and waste. Roosevelt counterattacked, condemning ““economic royalists.”“ FDR won all but two states. The Democrats controlled two-thirds of both houses of Congress."
36, 33," FDR’s Court-Packing Effort—1937","  Prior to the New Deal, the Supreme Court rarely overturned laws of Congress (only eight times between 1789 and 1910). But in May of 1935, the Court invalidated three New Deal programs including the AAA and NIRA. FDR complained that the Court was not up to date in its views. After his huge 1936 victory, he proposed a plan that would allow the appointment of as many as six additional Supreme Court justices. Roosevelt, of course, planned to appoint justices who would be sympathetic to the New Deal. This proposal was widely condemned as an attempt to overturn the constitutional separation of powers. Congress rejected it, and FDR lost some of his political influence as a result. However, in 1937 the Court upheld by 5-4 votes a minimum wage law for women, the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act. Shortly thereafter retirements from the Court allowed FDR to appoint sympathetic justices."
36, 34," Economist John Maynard Keynes","  Keynes argued that in order to lift an economy out of a depression, the government had to engage in massive deficit spending, that is, spending much more than it collected in taxes.  Although FDR had engaged in pump priming throughout the New Deal (spending government money to stimulate the economy), he had in some ways been a fiscal conservative who sought to limit federal deficits. Indeed, in 1937 with the economy showing signs of recovery, FDR cut back on New Deal spending. Unemployment rose, stocks lost value, and industrial production dropped in what has been called the Roosevelt Recession. But FDR eventually embraced Keynesian economics. And it was the massive deficit spending of WWII that finally lifted the country out of the Depression."
36, 35," Hatch Act—1939","  This act barred federal officials, except for top political office holders, from participating in political campaigns or raising campaign contributions. It forbade the use of government funds for political campaigns, and prohibited the collection of campaign contributions from people receiving relief payments. Key ID’s Ch. 37, 1933 – 1941 "
37, 1," Quarantine Speech—1937","  Roosevelt presented his fears about the international situation with Germany, Italy, and Japan. He said the rest of the world should behave the way a community behaves during an epidemic, ““It joins in a quarantine of the patients in order to protect the health of the community against the spread of disease.”“ Democratic nations should work together to isolate the aggressor nations.  Isolationists protested that this would move the US closer to a shooting war."
37, 2," Recognition of the USSR—1933 ","  Sixteen years after the Bolsheviks took power, the US finally granted them diplomatic recognition. FDR was motivated by the desire to increase trade and by the hope that a friendly Russia would help to counterbalance the power of Germany and Japan."
37, 3," Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy","  In his inaugural address, FDR repudiated his cousin’s Roosevelt Corollary, which claimed for the US the power of hemispheric police officer. The US pledged itself to a policy of nonintervention in Latin America, brought home the marines from Haiti, freed Cuba from the Platt Amendment, and removed similar restrictions from Panama. FDR was motivated by a desire to line up friendly nations in case of European aggression. In addition, dollar diplomacy made little sense in a world-wide depression when there was little US investment overseas."
37, 4," Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act—1934 ","  This act authorized the president to lower tariffs by as much as 50% on a country-by-country basis if the other nation was willing to make a similar reduction. These reductions did not need to be ratified by the Senate, bypassing the source of many of the huge tariff increases of the past. Secretary of State Cordell Hull negotiated agreements with twenty-one countries. The significance of this was that it changed the high tariff policy that the nation had followed since the Civil War and that it opened the door to the free trade era that followed WWII, an era marked by higher levels of international trade. "
37, 5," The Nye Committee Report—1934  ","  This congressional committee examined America’s entry into WWI. Its report noted that many corporations made lots of money from WWI. The report suggested that some large corporations urged Wilson to enter the war for business reasons. "
37, 6," Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936 & 1937","  Most Americans in the 1930’s were isolationists and believed that US participation in WWI had been a mistake. Further, most assumed that the Atlantic and Pacific oceans would insulate the US from foreign wars. And the failure of allies to pay war debts angered many Americans. Wary of repeating earlier foreign policy mistakes, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts to prevent US entanglement in another European war. These acts said that during a foreign war, no American could make loans to a belligerent, sell or transport munitions to a belligerent, or sail on a belligerent ship. In essence, these acts gave up America’s traditional rights as a neutral power and for which America had fought the War of 1812. The effect of the Neutrality Acts was to aid the aggressors who had already built up their arms.  "
37, 7," Panay Incident—December 1937","  Japan attacked a US Navy vessel in Chinese waters. The attack was no mistake. Japan offered an apology, payment for damages, and punishment for those responsible. Seventy percent of the American public favored pulling out of China completely, revealing the strength of the isolationists at this time. "
37, 8," Hitler & Austria—1938","  In February Hitler falsely claimed that Germans living in Austria were subject to various atrocities. Hitler called the Austrian chancellor to Germany, demanded a new Austrian government comprised of Austrian Nazis, and threatened attack if Austria refused. In March Hitler, citing abuses of Germans in Austria and claiming that all German-speaking people belong in one nation, invaded Austria and annexed it. This was known as the Anschluss (union)."
37, 9," Hitler, the Sudentenland of Czechoslovakia, & the Munich Conference—1938","  In May Hitler attempted to arouse the ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia; rumors of a German invasion circulated through Europe. Russia, France, and England issued warnings to Hitler not to invade; Hitler assured the world he would not. In September Britain and France entered into discussions with Hitler. Hitler’s territorial demands were excessive, and the western powers prepared for war. Finally, Hitler invited British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Premier Daladier to meet in Munich. There Hitler promised that the Sudetenland would be his last territorial demand. Britain and France pressured Czechoslovakia to capitulate. Chamberlain returned to a hero’s welcome in Britain, claiming that the Munich Pact had secured ““peace in our time.”“  Labeling the agreement appeasement, Winston Churchill disagreed, saying ““Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonor. They chose dishonor. They will have war.”“ In March of 1939, Hitler broke the Munich Pact and took the rest of Czechoslovakia. The Allies again prepared for war."
37, 10," German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact—August 1939","  This agreement surprised many people; fascism and communism were traditional enemies. But this freed Hitler to attack the West without fear of a two-front war. "
37, 11," Jewish Refugees & the Holocaust","  Although the nature of Hitler’s Final Solution was known in the US early in 1942, the US did not open its doors to Jewish refugees; immigration quotas limited the numbers admitted. Not until 1944 did the US establish a War Refugee Board to help rescue and relocate those condemned to concentration camps. Even at that point, the US military did not bomb rail lines leading to concentration camps, gas chambers, or crematoria. The WRB did save the lives of 220,000 people, but six million Jews and five million other ““undesirables”“ died in the death camps. (It should be noted that the rest of the world combined accepted only 100,000 Jewish refugees.) The US had several reasons for not doing more. 1) There was concern as to whether the country, in the middle of the Depression, could afford more poor and homeless. 2) The military did not want to divert bombs and other resources from military targets, arguing that this would lengthen the war. 3) America’s ally Britain was trying to pacify its Arab allies and did not want an influx of Jewish refugees into Palestine. The British concerns took precedence in Washington.  "
37, 12," Neutrality Act of 1939  ","  When France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, it quickly became clear that they would need American arms. FDR pressed Congress to change the existing Neutrality Acts.  In an effort to aid France and Britain while still maintaining US neutrality, Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1939; it allowed belligerents to purchase munitions if they paid cash and transported them on their own ships (cash-and-carry). Though it was neutrally worded, this act aided the Allies because the French and British navies controlled the Atlantic."
37, 13," Fall of France","  After the fall of Poland, there was lull, dubbed ““the phony war,”“ in Europe. Then in April 1940, Hitler struck. In six weeks, Germany conquered Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, and France.  America was stunned by the success of this blitzkrieg (lightning war). Congress appropriated a huge amount to build up the armed forces. Still a large minority of Americans stuck to an isolationist position."
37, 14," Conscription Act—Sept. 1940","  Another response to Hitler’s success in Europe was the Conscription Act, the nation’s first peacetime military draft."
37, 15," Havana Conference—1940 ","  Germany had conquered Denmark, France, and the Netherlands, all of whom had New World colonies. In Havana, the US and twenty Latin American nations pledged to uphold the principles of the Monroe Doctrine and resist further European intervention in the New World.    "
37, 16," America First Committee ","  The America First Committee, financed largely by Henry Ford and featuring spokesperson Charles Lindbergh, led the isolationist opposition to aiding Britain in its fight against Germany. Their position was that the US should concentrate on defending its own shores, should Hitler attack America after conquering Britain."
37, 17," The Destroyer Base Deal—September 1940","  FDR bypassed Congress with an executive agreement giving Britain fifty American destroyers in exchange for ninety-nine-year leases on valuable British island bases in the Western Hemisphere, mostly in the Caribbean. "
37, 18," Presidential election of 1940","  Since George Washington established the tradition, no president had sought a third term. Roosevelt, with war approaching, felt he had to break that tradition. The Republicans nominated political newcomer Wendell Wilkie. Both candidates promised to keep the nation out of war. Wilkie did agree with FDR on the need to give Great Britain more aid.  Republicans argued that no one man was indispensable in a democracy and that the two-term tradition was a necessary safeguard against dictatorship. Nonetheless, voters stuck with Roosevelt."
37, 19," Four Freedoms Speech—January 1941","  In his 1941 State of the Union address, FDR continued his efforts to persuade a reluctant American public that it was essential to aid Great Britain and to ramp up production in American war industries. Roosevelt explained the values that such efforts sought to protect: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear (by which FDR meant ““world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point… that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor). Roosevelt made clear that these were universal freedoms that should be enjoyed by all people throughout the world."
37, 20," Lend-Lease Act—March 1941","  Aid in the form of munitions, tools, food, etc. granted under specified conditions to those countries whose defense was deemed vital to the defense of the United States. FDR said the US should be the ““arsenal of democracy.”“ Roosevelt ordered that ships conveying lend-lease aid be accompanied partway across the Atlantic by the US Navy. When German submarines attacked, the US fought back, involving the US in a limited but undeclared war. The US provided aid to Britain and later to the USSR. FDR compared it to letting a neighbor use a hose when his or her house was on fire, to keep the blaze from spreading to one’s. On the other hand, Senator Taft compared it to lending someone chewing gum; you would not want it back.   Lend-lease was significant in that it helped sustain the Allied war effort, it moved the US away from its isolationist position, and it stimulated production of war materiel, essential when the US entered the war. "
37, 21," Sinking of the Robin Moor—May 1941","  When the Germans sank this US merchant vessel, the US retaliated by freezing all Axis assets (e.g., bank accounts) in the US, and Latin American firms with Axis connections were blacklisted. More importantly, the US Navy began convoying ships as far as Iceland (where British vessels took over)."
37, 22," Hitler’s Declaration of War Against the Soviets—June 1941","  Hitler decided to discard his Non-Aggression Pact, knock out the Soviet Union with a quick blow, seize its oil and other resources, and then focus his attention on Britain. After Germany attacked Russia, the US sent aid to the Soviets, hoping they could hold out against the Germans."
37, 23," Atlantic Charter—August 1941","  This agreement between FDR and Churchill established the principles for which the Allies fought: no territorial expansion, no territorial changes without the consent of the inhabitants, self-determination for all people, freer trade, cooperation for the improvement of other nations, disarming of all aggressors. Endorsed within a month by fifteen countries, including the Soviet Union, the Atlantic Charter became the basis for the United Nations. "
37, 24," USS Greer, Kearny, & Reuben James—1941","  In September, the US and Germany were still not at war. But when the destroyer Greer was fired on by a German sub, FDR ordered the navy to shoot German warships on sight. In October when the US warships Kearny and Reuben James were sunk, Congress modified the Neutrality Act of 1939 to allow the arming of merchant ships and to permit merchant ships to sail into combat zones carrying munitions for Britain."
37, 25," US Policy with Japan—1940-1941","  The US hoped to prevent Japan from expanding its empire in the Far East but hoped to avoid war, at least until a two-ocean navy had been built. The US also wanted to force Japan out of China and thought it could do so with economic pressure. Japan’s military was dependent on purchases of steel, scrap metal, oil, and gasoline from the US. In 1940 the US banned the sale of oil and scrap metal to Japan and limited the sale of aviation gasoline to the Western Hemisphere. In June 1941, the US froze Japanese assets."
37, 26," Pearl Harbor—December 7, 1941","  While this was a tactical success for Japan, wiping out the US Pacific battleship fleet, it effectively ended the isolationist resistance to US involvement in WWII. Key ID’s Ch. 38, 1939–1945 "
38, 1," Germany First","  The US declared war on Japan the day after Pearl Harbor. Germany and Italy, the other Axis powers, declared war on the US three days later. Despite the fact that Japan had initiated hostilities, the US agreed with Britain that it was essential to focus on defeating Germany. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed that if the US turned toward Japan, Germany might defeat both the USSR and Great Britain and emerge as the unconquerable power in Europe. But if the US joined with Britain and the USSR to defeat Germany, Japan could be defeated by the Allies later."
38, 2," A. Philip Randolph and the March on Washington—1941","  Blacks faced discrimination in war industries; the military was segregated. Randolph, president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, called for a march on Washington to demand equal treatment.  To head off this march, Roosevelt issued an executive order banning racial discrimination in war industries and establishing the Fair Employment Practices Committee. As a result, the proportion of blacks in war industries increased from 3% to 9%."
38, 3," Women and War","  More than 6 million women took jobs outside the home during WWII; half had never worked for wages before.  But most women did not work in war industries, and most Americans did not approve of such work for women. A 1945 poll showed that only 18% approved of married women working. A majority of American women said they would not take a job in a war plant if it were offered. At the end of the war, two-thirds of the women in war industries left their job, most voluntarily."
38, 4," Battle of Stalingrad—1942-1943","  Germany enjoyed initial success in its invasion of Russia, but the offensive bogged down at Stalingrad. A six-month battle led to a Russian victory, which was followed by a Russian offensive, pushing the Germans out of Russia. The Soviet Union suffered enormous losses in this and other battles on the Eastern Front. More Russians died in the battle of Stalingrad than the total number of Americans killed in the entire war. Twenty million Soviets died in WWII."
38, 5," Stalin’s Demand for a Second Front","  Stalin pressed FDR and Churchill to attack Germany from the west. He hoped this would divert German resources to the Western Front and ease the pressure on Russia. In Stalin’s mind, the terrible losses the Soviet Union was suffering made this essential. Churchill remembered how the Allies had become bogged down in France in WWI and resisted. FDR supported Churchill’s position. Allied efforts were focused instead on northern Africa and eventually Italy. Not until June 1944 did the British and Americans attack through France. Stalin’s suspicions that England and the US were content to let the USSR do most of the fighting and dying against Germany hardened eventually into the Cold War. "
38, 6," Teheran Conference—1943 ","  Here Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to open a second front through France in coordination with a Soviet push on the Eastern Front. In addition, the Big Three decided to divide post-war Germany into zones of occupation."
38, 7," War Production Board (WPB)","  The WPB coordinated industrial production during the war. It halted the production of nonessential consumer goods, rationed key raw materials such as rubber, and distributing contracts to manufacturers. The US alone managed to produce more war materiel than the Axis nations combined."
38, 8," Office of Price Administration (OPA)","  This was started to prevent inflation from sky-rocketing. It fixed rents, set a maximum price on goods, and had power to ration goods. Staple goods (sugar, meat, gasoline, etc.) could only be bought if one had stamps from ration books. Inflation stayed below 30 percent—half the increase that took place during World War I.   "
38, 9," Relocation of Japanese-Americans","  Following the attack by the Japanese military on Pearl Harbor, the American military became concerned about an assault on the West Coast where 120,000 Japanese-Americans lived. Numerous reports were made to the military of suspicious activity, e.g., Japanese-Americans sending coded radio messages to Japanese boats off-shore. These reports were found to be false. No Japanese-Americans was charged with sabotage or spying during WWII. On May 9, 1942, Executive Order 9066 required all Japanese-Americans to leave the West Coast and southern Arizona. A total of 120,000 people (70,000 of them US citizens) were given a few days to sell or store their possessions, houses, and businesses and report to relocation centers. From there they were shipped to ten internment camps. In 1944 in the case Korematsu v. US, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the relocation order as a wartime necessity."
38, 10," The Battle of Midway and Island Hopping","  Japan enjoyed early success in the Pacific, taking the Philippines, Guam, Malay, and Burma. But following the US victory at Midway Island in June 1942, the Americans began moving towards the Japanese home islands.  Midway— June 4-7, 1942— was the turning point in the Pacific. The Japanese had planned to entrap and destroy US naval forces, but code-breaking by the US gave the Americans the element of surprise. Japan lost four aircraft carriers and hundreds of planes and experienced pilots, military resources Japan was not able to replace. After Midway, Japan was not able to mount another serious attack in the Pacific. Island hopping meant leaving in place some of the islands most heavily fortified, capturing nearby but less strongly defended islands, building airfields there, and then bombing the enemy bases and Japan itself."
38, 11,"  D-Day Invasion—June 1944","  Led by US General Dwight Eisenhower, the US and Britain landed at Normandy, France, in the largest amphibious invasion in military history and finally opened a second front against Germany in 1944. By the end of summer, the Allies had driven the Germans out of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg."
38, 12," Yalta Conference—February 1945","  At this meeting of the Big Three to plan for the end of the war, FDR pressed Stalin to enter the war against Japan, the invasion of which promised huge casualties. Churchill and FDR made territorial concessions regarding Manchuria to Stalin who promised to enter the war against Japan three months after the surrender of Germany. Stalin also promised free elections in eastern Europe which Russia controlled. Critics have condemned FDR for not forcing Stalin to promise to leave eastern Europe free of Soviet control, of allowing the Iron Curtain to be drawn across the continent. But the reality was that the Soviet army already controlled eastern Europe; FDR could only force Stalin out by declaring WWIII."
38, 13," Potsdam Conference—July 1945","  At this meeting, Truman joined Churchill and Stalin. With Germany defeated, Japan was the main focus. The Allies threatened Japan with destruction if it did not surrender. Regarding Germany, the Big Three agreed to joint occupation of Germany."
38, 14," Manhattan Project","  In 1939, Albert Einstein, a Jewish refugee from Hitler’s Germany, warned FDR that German scientists were working to develop an atomic bomb. The Manhattan Project was the U.S. Army project begun in 1941 to research and develop an atomic bomb to be used in warfare.  Research headquarters in Alamogordo, New Mexico, reported the first successful atomic denotation on July 16, 1945."
38, 15," Hiroshima & Nagasaki—August 1945","  Despite a US fire-bombing raid on Tokyo in March 1945 that killed 84,000 civilians, the Japanese showed no sign of surrender. Allied war planners estimated that an invasion of the home islands of Japan would result in one million US casualties, along with British, Russian, and Japanese casualties. After the US captured Okinawa, the Japanese emperor sought to negotiate an end to the war. The Allies, however, demanded unconditional surrender as had been required of the Germans. When Japan ignored Truman’s ultimatum to surrender or face ““utter destruction,”“ the president made the decision to use the atomic bomb. Hiroshima was hit on August 6; 130,000 people died from the blast or from burns and radiation sickness. On August 9, Nagasaki was attacked with a second bomb; 80,000 were listed as killed or missing. Japan surrendered on August 14. Key ID’s Ch. 39, 1945-1952 "
39, 1," Taft-Hartley Act—1947","  Although World War II had brought full employment to the American worker, wages had generally not risen. When inflation hit 25% in 1946, increasing numbers of unions, freed from the wartime ban on strikes imposed by patriotism, struck for higher wages. A record number of strikes in many industries hit the nation. In particular, a railroad strike paralyzed the economy. The congressional sentiment that made the Wagner Act possible in 1935 began to shift after World War II. The damaging strikes of 1946 set the stage for the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This act 1) banned the closed shop, 2) allowed states to pass right-to-work laws banning union shops, 3) prohibited secondary boycotts, 4) required a sixty-day cooling off period before a strike, and 5) allowed the federal government to impose an eighty-day injunction on strikes affecting the national welfare. President Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act, calling it a slave-labor bill. Congress passed the bill over the president’s veto. "
39, 2," The Employment Act 1946","  This committed the federal government to ensuring economic growth. It established the president’s Council of Economic Advisors to help reach this goal. A conservative Congress stripped from the original bill the goal of full employment and the enhanced executive powers Truman wanted to achieve that objective."
39, 3," The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act—1944 ","  Popularly known as the GI Bill of Rights, this provided money for college and loans to help purchase homes.  The primary intent was to avoid a postwar recession. It did so in part by taking a large number of veterans out of the labor market and sending them to college (where they gained the skills to drive America’s postwar boom) and by expanding the demand for new home construction."
39, 4," The Postwar Economic Boom—1945-1970","  National income doubled in the 1950’s and nearly doubled again in the 1960’s. Almost 60% of American families owned their own homes in 1960 compared with less than 40% in the 1920’s. Causes of the Boom: 1) an industrial base untouched by WWII, 2) a high level of government spending, especially for defense, 3) cheap energy, 4) increased industrial productivity resulting in part from a better-educated workforce, 5) increased farm productivity (15% of the nation farmed in 1945; 2% in 1990)."
39, 5," American Mobility","  Always a restless people, Americans became more mobile after WWII with at least 30 million people changing residences every year. In particular, Americans moved from the old industrial Northeast to the Sunbelt, the South and Southwest. This was in part due to heavy federal spending in Sunbelt states. One effect of this was to shift the political center of the nation from the Northeast to the Sunbelt. For example, between 1952 and 2012, all presidents except Kennedy and Obama came from Sunbelt states."
39, 6," Suburbs","  With GI Bill home loans, federal tax deductions for home mortgage payments, and increasing prosperity, home ownership in the suburbs became more attractive than apartment life in the cities. By 1960 one American in four lived in a suburb. One effect of this was that cities increasingly became enclaves of minorities and the poor. Urban problems became more concentrated and intense as the middle and upper class moved out in a phenomenon known as white flight."
39, 7," Social Conformity and Rebellion","  Related to this move to the suburbs was an increase in social conformity. Critics noted adherence to stereotyped gender roles, subordination of individuality to careerism, and the supplanting of spiritual values with consumerism. One reaction to this conformity was the Beat Movement. Writers such as Allen Ginsburg (whose poem ““Howl”“ excoriated the mechanization and materialism of society) and Jack Kerouac (whose novel On the Road glorified a life of spontaneity and freedom from cultural norms) provided an alternative vision. A second reaction was rock-and-roll music. Originating in the field hollers of plantation slaves, spirituals of the black church, and blues of the Mississippi delta, rock crossed over to white teen audiences in the 1950’s. Southern conservatives saw it as part of a plot to foul the purity of white blood.  Others were convinced that rock would unleash the animal instinct in teenagers, leading to sexual promiscuity. Not surprisingly, these condemnations by adult authority figures only enhanced the popularity of rock music."
39, 8," Levittown","  In 1946 William Levitt built the first post-war planned suburb on a former potato field on Long Island, New York. Every house was identical with trees placed every twenty-eight feet; critics saw these cookie-cutter housing developments as evidence of social conformity. However, residents were delighted with the sturdy, inexpensive ($7,990) houses. Levitt held down prices by using assembly-line techniques to build entire communities; crews finished a house every fifteen minutes."
39, 9," The Baby Boom ","  Between 1946 and 1964, Americans cranked out tons of babies. By 1957, there was an American baby born every seven seconds. The huge size of this generation (76 million) ensured that it would have disproportionate effect on society (emphasis on child rearing the 1950’s, the youth culture of the 1960’s, a home construction boom in the 1970’s, etc.). As the baby boomers aged, the size of this generation created challenges of funding entitlement programs for the elderly including Social Security and Medicare. These programs caused a ballooning of the nation debt."
39, 10," Bretton Woods Conference—1944","  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established to regulate and stabilize international currency exchange rates and thus to encourage world trade. The World Bank was set up to provide for economic development projects in less developed countries."
39, 11," The United Nations—1945 ","  Intended to be a more robust version of the League of Nations, the UN has a general assembly and a Security Council with five permanent members (US, USSR, Britain, France, and China) who can veto Security Council actions. "
39, 12," Bernard Baruch & Atomic Energy—1946 ","  Baruch, US delegate to the UN, called for an international organization run by the UN to oversee and control atomic energy and research. The US offered to destroy its own atomic weapons and share its technical expertise with the rest of the world on two conditions: 1) an international agency be set up to ensure that nuclear technology be used only for peaceful purposes and 2) this agency have the power to conduct unlimited inspections and punish offenders without the restrictions of Security Council vetoes. The Soviets rejected this. The US rejected a Soviet counter-proposal, and the two nations spent the next fifty years in a nuclear arms race. "
39, 13," Nuremberg War Trials—1945-1946","  Nazi leaders were charged with waging aggressive war and violating generally accepted rules of how to treat prisoners of war and how to behave toward civilians in occupied territory.  Twelve of the twenty-two were sentenced to death and three were acquitted.  In Tokyo top officials were also charged, and Premier Hideki Tojo, along with several others, was sentenced to death.  Critics protested that these trials were unfair because many of the accused were charged with offenses that had not been clear-cut crimes before the war began."
39, 14," Iron Curtain","  In a 1946 speech, Winston Churchill used the phrase ““iron curtain”“ to describe the line of Soviet control over Eastern Europe. Countries behind the Iron Curtain were described as satellites of the USSR."
39, 15," Berlin Airlift—1948-1949","  In an attempt to dislodge the Allies from West Berlin, Stalin cut off access by road and rail. Truman refused to bow to Soviet intimidation and yet did not want to go to war.  Instead, American and British air crews brought in 2.5 million tons of supplies (food, fuel, medicine, even coal) by air for almost a year. Stalin eventually backed down. This episode made clear the US determination to resist Soviet aggression during the Cold War."
39, 16," The Policy of Containment","  In 1946 Stalin announced that there could be no peace between communism and capitalism. US diplomat George F. Kennan wrote a long memo in which he described the inexorable Soviet tendency to expand unless it was contained by an overwhelming force. Kennan recommended a US policy of using economic, diplomatic, and military pressure to contain the Soviet Union and prevent it from gaining control of any new territory."
39, 17," The Truman Doctrine—1947","  When Greece and Turkey were threatened by communist subversion, Britain announced that it was broke and could not aid them. Truman pledged the US to provide economic and military aid to nations threatened by armed minorities or outside groups. Congress sent $400 million to Turkey and Greece to help them resist communism. Truman’s view was that it would be cheaper in lives and dollars to strengthen allies when they were threatened than to fight a war to free them after they fell to communism."
39, 18," The Marshall Plan—1947","  With the economy of Europe still struggling after WWII and with several Western European nations facing the threat of communist takeover, Secretary of State George Marshall proposed a massive program of aid to rebuild Europe. Republicans in Congress were committed to a return to isolationism, but when communists took over Czechoslovakia in February 1948, Congress quickly approved the Marshall Plan.  Although the aid was offered to all European nations, the Soviet bloc rejected it as a US attempt to gain economic control of Europe. Western Europe’s economy improved with Marshall Plan aid. The US also benefited from Marshall Plan-financed purchases by Europe as well as having stronger European economies to trade with."
39, 19," National Security Act—1947","  As a response to the Cold War, Congress passed the National Security Act, unifying the armed forces in one Department of Defense and creating the Central Intelligence Agency to coordinate the gathering of foreign intelligence and the National Security Council to advise the president."
39, 20," Voice of America—1948","  This government agency was created to make radio (and later TV) broadcasts of news and entertainment into foreign countries, especially into those controlled by communists."
39, 21," The Selective Service System—1948","  In another response to the Cold War, Congress brought back the draft to provide the military with sufficient forces for containment."
39, 22," North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)—1949","  This was an attempt to use collective security to contain Soviet expansion. Member states agreed that an attack on one would be regarded as an attack on them all and pledged to use armed force if necessary to defend NATO members.  Original members included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States.  Later on Greece, Turkey, and West Germany joined.  "
39, 23," America in Asia—1940’s ","  Success in Japan: Under General Douglas MacArthur, the US enjoyed strong success in the democratization of Japan. MacArthur dictated to the Japanese a new parliamentary constitution renouncing militarism. The Japanese cooperated fully, and the US occupation was relatively brief and successful. Failure in China: The US had for years been supporting nationalist Jiang Jieshi against communist Mao Zedong. But corruption and a reluctance to engage in land reform doomed the nationalist effort. In 1949 Mao triumphed and Jiang and his supporters fled to the island of Taiwan (Formosa). The communist triumph led to much debate and recrimination in the US as to who lost China, one element in the Red Scare of the 1940’s and 50’s. "
39, 24," Soviet Atomic and Nuclear Arms","  In 1949 the Soviets exploded an atomic bomb, several years before US experts thought they would be able to do so. No longer did the US have a monopoly on atomic weapons with which to control the Soviets. In response Truman ordered the development of the hydrogen bomb or H-bomb (fusion), a weapon many times more powerful than the atomic bomb (fission). The US first exploded a hydrogen bomb in 1952, but the Soviets tested theirs in 1953.  Americans assumed that the Soviet spies must have stolen US atomic secrets in order for the Russians to develop weapons so quickly, another element in the Red Scare of the 1940’s and 50’s."
39, 25," Truman’s Loyalty Review Board—1947  ","  In order to demonstrate the administration’s anticommunist fervor, Truman set up a Loyalty Review Board to check government employees for signs of communism.  After a list was drawn up by the Attorney General of ““subversive”“ organizations, 3.2 million government employees were investigated.  No employees were formally charged, but around 200 were dismissed as to security risks and 2,900 resigned or withdrew their applications.   "
39, 26," Smith Act—1940","  The Smith Act was the first peacetime anti-sedition law since 1798. It banned any advocacy of the violent overthrow of the government. In 1949 eleven leaders of the American Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act. The Supreme Court upheld the convictions in Dennis v. US, ruling that communism presented a clear and present danger to the US."
39, 27," House Un-American Activities Committee ","  In 1947 HUAC began a series of hearings on the influence of communism on American life. One set of investigations looked into communist influence in film; the Hollywood Ten were blacklisted for refusing to testify about their past political activity or associates. Richard Nixon rose to national prominence with the HUAC investigation of Alger Hiss, State Department official who had been an advisor at Yalta and who had helped organize founding of the UN. Though Hiss was not convicted of espionage, he was convicted of perjury, spreading concerns that highly placed officials were aiding communists, another element in the Red Scare of the 1940’s and 50’s.  (In the 1990’s, Soviet documents were uncovered that implicated Hiss in espionage.)"
39, 28," Julius and Ethel Rosenberg","  In 1950, the British arrested Klaus Fuchs, a scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project. Fuchs confessed to passing atomic secrets to the Soviets during WWII. Named among his associates were the Rosenbergs. Despite their protests of innocence, they were convicted of espionage in 1951 and executed in 1953, the only Americans ever executed in peacetime for espionage, another element in the Red Scare of the 1940’s and 50’s. (In the 1990’s, Soviet documents were uncovered that implicated Julius but not Ethel in espionage.)"
39, 29," Senator Joseph R. McCarthy—1950-1954","  McCarthy originally focused on anti-communism as a re-election tactic; it proved successful. McCarthy was noted for his sensational charges and lack of solid evidence; he did not uncover a single spy or case of subversion.  In 1954 McCarthy accused the US Army of being soft on communism. In a dramatic series of televised hearings, McCarthy exposed himself to the country as a bully and a blowhard. His influence waned, and he was censured by Congress for contemptuous behavior. But for a period of time, he was the most feared man in America."
39, 30," The Election of 1948","  Truman faced a daunting challenge in 1948. Republicans had won control of Congress in 1946 and appeared to be ready to win back the White House with their nominee Thomas Dewey. The Democrats hoped to dump Truman and draft Eisenhower (who declined to run). Then the Democrats split three ways: Strom Thurmond led a walkout of Southern Democrats offended by Truman’s support for civil rights (Thurmond won four Southern states.) Henry Wallace, opposed to Truman’s strong Cold War position, led the left wing of the Democratic Party into the new Progressive Party. Truman, however, refused to concede. He ran an aggressive whistle-stop campaign, giving the ““Do-Nothing”“ Republican Congress ““hell”“ for its passage of the Taft-Hartley Act and speaking in favor of civil rights and health insurance. He won."
39, 31," Truman’s Point Four Program","  The fourth point of Truman’s inaugural address dealt with a plan to lend money to poor countries for economic development. Truman hoped that economic development would help these nations resist communism."
39, 32," The Fair Deal ","  Truman’s Fair Deal sought to continue and extend FDR’s New Deal. Truman managed to win a minimum wage increase, a public housing bill, and an extension of Social Security to more beneficiaries. He was unsuccessful in his call for national health insurance, aid to education, civil rights legislation, and the repeal of Taft-Hartley. "
39, 33," NSC-68—1950","  At the end of WWII, the US military demobilized and dropped troop strength from 12 million to 1.5 million. Defense spending dropped from $76 billion in 1945 to $20 billion in 1946.   National Security Council Memorandum 68 recommended that the US quadruple defense spending to meet the challenges of the Cold War. Initially this recommendation was ignored, but the Korean War cleared the way for its implementation. By 1953 defense spending took up two-thirds of the federal budget. "
39, 34," The Korean War—1950-1953","  After WWII, Korea, a colony of Japan since 1910, had been divided into two areas occupied by the USSR and the US. In June of 1950, North Korean communist forces invaded South Korea. With UN approval, President Truman ordered US troops to respond. The communist forces nearly pushed the UN troops off the Korean peninsula. But a dramatic counteroffensive led by General Douglas MacArthur at Inchon reversed the tide. MacArthur drove the communist forces back across the 38th parallel and close to the Chinese border.  MacArthur wanted to extend the war into China to eliminate communism in Asia. Truman wanted to fight a limited war, fearing an invasion of China would lead to WWIII and would leave Western Europe without US protection. The dispute escalated with MacArthur making his disagreements with his commander-in-chief public. Truman finally relieved MacArthur of his command. Chinese forces entered the war in November of 1950 and pushed the UN forces back to the 38th parallel. There the war remained stalemated for two years while treaty negotiators haggled over terms.  Key ID’s Ch. 40, 1953–1960 "
40, 1," Desegregation of the Military—1948","  Prior to the War of 1812, blacks fought in integrated military units. But from 1812 through WWII, US military units were segregated. Following WWII, President Truman was appalled by the killing of several black veterans. Because he feared legislation in Congress would be blocked by Southerners, Truman decided to desegregate the military through an executive order. Executive Order 9981, signed on July 26, 1948, barred discrimination against military personnel on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin."
40, 2," Rosa Parks—1955","  In Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white man on a city bus. Her arrest led to a year-long boycott led by Martin Luther King, Jr. Eventually the Supreme Court affirmed a decision outlawing segregation on the buses. This boycott brought Martin Luther King to national prominence. It also demonstrated the power of nonviolent protest."
40, 3," Brown v. Board of Education—1954","  Linda Brown had been denied permission to attend her neighborhood school in Topeka, a school reserved for whites. This unanimous decision by the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools ““are inherently unequal”“ and that they should be desegregated with ““all deliberate speed.”“  This, perhaps the most significant Supreme Court decision of the century, overturned the 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson that had allowed ““separate but equal”“ facilities.  One significant figure in the desegregation fight was attorney Thurgood Marshall. For many years the chief counsel for the NAACP, Marshall successfully argued the Brown case before the Supreme Court and in 1967 became the first African American justice on the Supreme Court."
40, 4," White Citizens’ Councils","  Eighty percent of Southern whites opposed the Brown decision. President Eisenhower’s refusal to publicly endorse Brown encouraged white resistance. The KKK was revitalized, and groups such as the White Citizens’ Councils, more respectable than the Klan but just as opposed to integration, sprang up."
40, 5," Central High School—1957","  When Governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas called out the National Guard to block the integration of Little Rock’s Central High by nine black students, Eisenhower was forced to act. He sent federal troops to protect the students from mob violence. After that school year, Faubus shut down Little Rock’s public high schools for a year rather than cooperate with integration, a tactic that was copied in many areas of the South."
40, 6," Civil Rights Act of 1957","  This was the first federal civil rights law since Reconstruction. It established a permanent federal commission to investigate violations of civil rights. Eisenhower reassured Southerners that it was ““the mildest civil rights bill possible.”“"
40, 7," The Southern Christian Leadership Conference","  Formed by Martin Luther King in 1957, this organization of black preachers helped to guide the civil rights movement. The SCLC was a force for nonviolent change."
40, 8," Greensboro Sit-Ins—1960","  Four black college students went to a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro, asked to be served, and refused to leave when they weren’t. They came back the next day, and others joined them. Over five months, the sit-ins in Greensboro grew and spread to other cities throughout the South. "
40, 9," Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee","  To coordinate the growing sit-in movement, SNCC was formed. SNCC was one of the sponsors of 1964’s Freedom Summer, which trained black and white college students in the tactics of nonviolence to register blacks as voters in Mississippi. By the mid-1960’s SNCC leaders were losing patience with the slow pace of the mainstream civil rights movement led by the SCLC and NAACP and were calling for black power."
40, 10," Ho Chi Minh ","  Ho had been fighting for Vietnamese independence since WWI. In 1946 he led the Vietminh, a movement that declared independence from France. The US opposed this, since Ho was a communist, and supported the French war to defeat Ho. By 1954 the US was paying 80% of the cost of the French fight to retain its colony."
40, 11," Domino Theory","  Eisenhower, as well as later US presidents, subscribed to the domino theory. This was the belief that once one country fell to communism, its neighbors would be likely to topple like a row of dominoes. With the fall of China in 1949, the first domino had fallen. American presidents were determined to stop the process there.  This was part of the doctrine of containment."
40, 12," Dien Bien Phu—1954","  In 1954 the Vietminh surrounded 12,000 French troops at the fortress of Dien Bien Phu. The French asked for American troops, Eisenhower refused, and the French had to surrender. Following the French surrender, an international conference in Geneva arranged for Vietnam to be divided temporarily at the seventeenth parallel and for elections to be held in 1956 to choose the government of a unified Vietnam."
40, 13," Ngo Dinh Diem","  The US helped to install Diem, a fierce anticommunist, in power in South Vietnam. When it became clear that Ho would defeat Diem in the 1956 elections, Diem, with US backing, pulled out of the elections.  Diem was never popular in South Vietnam. A Catholic in a Buddhist country, he aroused anger by suppressing the Buddhist majority. He refused to implement land reform, and his government was marked by corruption. Finally, with the approval of the Kennedy administration, Diem was overthrown in a coup and killed."
40, 14," SEATO—1954","  The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, with the US, Britain, and France joining nations from the area, was a counterpart of NATO. SEATO pledged mutual aid to resist armed aggression including civil wars involving foreign aggression."
40, 15," Geneva Summit Meeting—1955","  This was the first US-Soviet summit since WWII. Though no agreements were reached, the US was encouraged by the friendly nature of the talks."
40, 16," Hungarian Revolt—1956","  When the government of Hungary announced its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union sent troops and tanks to crush the revolt. The US declined to intervene."
40, 17," Suez Crisis—1956","  President Nasser of Egypt needed foreign aid to build the Aswan Dam on the Nile. The US offered the money but refused to sell him the weapons he wanted. So Nasser turned to the USSR for aid and nationalized the Suez Canal. Britain and France tried to seize the canal by force. The US forced the allies to withdraw their troops."
40, 18," Eisenhower Doctrine","  This focused on the strategically important Middle East, which President Eisenhower saw as vulnerable to communism. Eisenhower offered Middle East nations economic and military aid and promised armed support to repel communist aggression. Egypt and Syria rejected the Eisenhower Doctrine as a US plot to dominate the Arab world."
40, 19," Brinkmanship","  During the Cold War, the US expressed its willingness to threaten nuclear war to deter Soviet expansion. The assumption was that the Soviets, seeing the US on the brink of war and apparently willing to take the next step, would back down rather than risk WWIII."
40, 20," Massive Retaliation","  Massive retaliation was the US doctrine that any Soviet aggression would be countered with the full force of the American nuclear arsenal."
40, 21," Sputnik—1957","  When the Soviets launched the first satellite into earth orbit, it led to fears of Soviet technological superiority. Americans feared that this could give the Soviets a space platform for launching nuclear missiles. The American response included increased spending on science education and the creation of NASA to coordinate the US space program."
40, 22," Missile Gap","  After Sputnik, Democrats charged that the Eisenhower administration had allowed America fall behind in the space race. In his 1960 presidential campaign, John Kennedy blamed Republicans for a missile gap. In reality, the Soviets trailed the Americans in intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.  "
40, 23," National Defense and Education Act—1958","  At the time of Sputnik, the USSR produced twice as many scientists and engineers as did the US. Congress passed the NDEA to close this real gap. The NDEA provided loans to students and funds for teacher training and for the development of new instructional material for science, math, and foreign languages."
40, 24," U-2 Incident—1960","  Shortly before President Eisenhower was to meet with Soviet Premier Khrushchev in Paris, the Soviets shot down an American U-2 spy plane deep in Soviet territory. Eisenhower at first tried to cover up, claiming that the plane was a weather plane that had flown off course. But eventually he had to admit to spying on Russia (which, of course, was spying on the US). This soured already bad relations with the USSR. The Paris summit accomplished nothing."
40, 25," Military-Industrial Complex","  In 1961 just before he left office, Eisenhower, a former five-star general, warned the country against the combined power of the military and defense contractors to influence public policy. Said Eisenhower, ““The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.”“  "
40, 26," Landrum-Griffin Act—1959","  Congress passed the Landrum-Griffin Act in l959 with the intent of policing the internal affairs of labor unions. The act called for regular union elections and secret ballots and required union leaders to report on their unions’ finances. It also prohibited ex-convicts and communists from holding union office. The Landrum-Griffin Act was passed because during the late l950’s the American public became concerned over reports that some labor union leaders had misappropriated funds and were involved in corruption."
40, 27," The Affluent Society—1958","  This book by economist John Kenneth Galbraith took a critical look at the American economy. His view was that the emphasis on continual production led to the creation of artificial wants through advertising and to an eventual condition of private wealth and overconsumption while public goods (roads, schools, hospitals) are neglected. Key ID’s Ch. 41, 1960-1968 "
41, 1," Kennedy’s Inaugural Address—1961","  At his inauguration, the young president set a challenging and inspiring tone. He called on Americans to be ready for the challenges of the Cold War (““We will pay any price, bear any burden”“) and for a life of service to the country and the world (““Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”“)."
41, 2," Peace Corps—1961","  The Peace Corps was a manifestation of the idealism of the inaugural address. It sent American volunteers to third world countries to teach, improve health care, and share advanced farming techniques. By 2009 195,000 volunteers had served in 139 countries around the world."
41, 3," Berlin Wall—1961","  When Soviet Premier Khrushchev met Kennedy in Vienna in 1961, he told Kennedy that the US refusal to remove its troops from divided Berlin was a provocation that could lead to war. Kennedy responded by increasing draft calls, ordering reservists to active duty, and asking Congress for increased defense appropriations. In August, the Soviets sealed off their zone of Berlin and constructed a wall to stop the flow of Germans from the communist East Berlin to the democratic West Berlin. The Berlin Wall became a visible symbol of the Soviet willingness to use force to maintain control over Eastern Europe. Over the years, 192 people died trying to cross the Wall into freedom."
41, 4," Flexible Response","  JFK and his Defense Secretary Robert McNamara developed a strategy of flexible response. Where the tendency in the Eisenhower years had been to replace troops with nuclear weapons (to get ““more bang for the buck”“) and then to rely on massive retaliation to deter Soviet aggression, Kennedy wanted a range of options to enable the US to match the level of force to the provocation. To carry this out, Kennedy increased funding for conventional forces and strengthened the Green Berets. The drawback to this approach is that it made US military involvement in foreign conflicts more likely since the military had options other than nuclear annihilation."
41, 5," American Military Advisers in Vietnam ","  Like Eisenhower, JFK was a believer in the domino theory. Determined not to allow communism to gain more ground in Asia, Kennedy increased the number of American troops in Vietnam from 700 to 16,000 by the end of 1963. These troops were not supposed to fight the enemy but to train the South Vietnamese forces to fight effectively."
41, 6," Bay of Pigs Invasion—April 1961","  To eliminate the perceived menace of a communist Cuba ninety miles from the US, the Eisenhower administration had developed plans to invade Cuba with a force of Cuban exiles supported by the CIA. This would, the CIA thought, lead to a general uprising of the Cuban people who would overthrow Fidel Castro. When Kennedy became president, he approved the invasion. The invasion was a disaster. Kennedy decided not to provide necessary air support in an attempt to hide US involvement. The Cubans captured 1,200 of the invaders, who were held for two years until ransomed for $62 million in medicine and humanitarian supplies. Kennedy continued to work against Castro and support efforts to assassinate him."
41, 7," Cuban Missile Crisis—October 1962","  With clear evidence that the US was willing to take hostile actions against the communist regime in Cuba, the Soviet Union decided to put intermediate range missiles in Cuba. This would serve as a deterrent to another US attack. When US U-2 spy planes brought back photos showing the construction of launch sites, Kennedy demanded that Russia remove the missiles. He announced a naval quarantine (a blockade) to stop any additional missiles from being delivered. And he warned that the US would dismantle the missiles already in Cuba by force if the Soviets did not remove them. Nuclear war appeared near, but the Soviets decided to respect the quarantine and removed the missiles in return for a US promise never to invade Cuba."
41, 8," Nuclear Test Ban Treaty—1963","  Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, both nations took steps to reduce tensions. A hotline allowing instantaneous communication between Washington and Moscow in case of a crisis was installed. Kennedy gave an address at American University calling for both sides to rethink the Cold War. In July the US, USSR, and Great Britain agreed to ban nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere (atmospheric tests had spread radioactive fallout around the globe), in space, and under water. This was seen as a significant step toward a more peaceful world."
41, 9," Freedom Rides—1961","  The Supreme Court had desegregated interstate travel, but this ruling was widely ignored in the South. An interracial group sought to test this ruling by riding busses through the South with blacks using facilities designated for whites and vice versa. The group was beaten by mobs and jailed, but the Freedom Rides forced the Kennedy administration to support the desegregation of interstate travel. One notable figure was John Lewis. Then only twenty-one, Lewis went on to serve as the head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), to act as one of the Big Six organizing the 1963 March on Washington, to help organize Freedom Summer, to co-lead the March from Selma to Montgomery, and to serve as a long-time congressman from Georgia."
41, 10," Police Dogs and Fire Hoses in Birmingham—1963 ","  Birmingham, Alabama, was considered the most segregated city in the nation. Martin Luther King sought to use nonviolent confrontation to challenge the segregation laws. Birmingham officials obtained an injunction barring protests. King and others were arrested. While in jail, King composed his ““Letter from Birmingham Jail,”“ defending nonviolent protest and asserting the moral obligation to break unjust laws. Wrote King, ““Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”“ The protests drew national attention when hundreds of children were jailed for marching and when Birmingham officials used police dogs and fire hoses to turn back the marchers."
41, 11," Martin Luther King’s March on Washington—August 1963","  Civil rights groups planned a massive march on Washington to show support for proposed civil rights legislation. Two hundred thousand people marched and heard King’s ““I Have a Dream”“ speech."
41, 12," 1964 Presidential Election","  The Democrats nominated Kennedy’s successor Lyndon Johnson and wrote their most liberal platform since Fair Deal. Johnson promised to keep American soldiers out of the fighting in Vietnam. The Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater who supported an end to the graduated income tax, questioned Social Security, opposed civil rights legislation, and recommended bombing North Vietnam. Johnson won by a landslide; the Democrats won large majorities in Congress as well."
41, 13," LBJ’s Great Society ","  Johnson’s political hero was FDR. He proposed a New Deal-like program, the Great Society. This had two main goals: fighting a war on poverty and passing meaningful civil rights legislation. In addition LBJ pushed through Congress aid to education, Medicare and Medicaid, support for the arts, and immigration reform."
41, 14," The Other America—1962 ","  Michael Harrington’s book The Other America documented the persistence of poverty in the US. He noted the high rate of poverty among the elderly, among the working poor who often received less than minimum wage, and among minorities. This book is credited with helping to stimulate Johnson’s war on poverty and win support for Medicare (health care for the elderly), Medicaid (health care for the poor), and an indexing of Social Security benefits to keep pace with rising inflation."
41, 15," Mississippi Freedom Summer—1964","  Organized by SNCC and CORE (the Congress of Racial Equality), Freedom Summer targeted Mississippi as the state most hostile to racial equality and attempted to register as many black voters as possible. Only 6.7 percent of African Americans in the state were registered to vote, the lowest percentage in the country.  Black and white college students were trained in nonviolence. Facing threats and attacks including killings from the KKK and others, the students registered 1200 new black voters. In addition, Freedom Summer volunteers ran Freedom Schools to improve education for black children and started the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party that sent a delegation to the national Democratic convention, demanding that the party recognize and eliminate racial discrimination within the party. One notable individual was Fannie Lou Hamer, a former sharecropper who became vice chair of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and whose plainspoken eloquence drew national attention to her cause."
41, 16," Malcolm X","  A powerful spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X presented the message that African Americans needed to ““wake up, clean up, and stand up”“ to achieve freedom. In other words, blacks couldn’t rely on whites granting freedom; blacks needed to seize their freedom ““by any means necessary.”“ Rather than hoping for integration, Malcolm and the Nation of Islam favored separatism and black self-sufficiency.  Although he did not originate the term black power, Malcolm advocated many of its principles prior to his assassination in 1965."
41, 17," Black Power Movement","  SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael first popularized the term black power. This meant taking pride in black culture and history, the rejection of integration and assimilation as a goal, and urging blacks to act together for their common interest and to stand together to assert their rights. One manifestation of the Black Power movement was the Black Panther party that monitored police behavior, provided meals to poor children, and got involved in a number of violent confrontations with police."
41, 18," Twenty-Fourth Amendment—1964","  This banned poll taxes in federal elections, one of the techniques that was still being used in five Southern states to discourage voting by African Americans. A 1966 Supreme Court decision outlawed poll taxes in all elections."
41, 19," Civil Rights Act—1964","  With Johnson’s strong support, Congress passed the strongest civil rights law in American history. This law banned discrimination in public accommodations, gave the federal government new powers to fight discrimination in voting and education, and forbade discrimination in employment."
41, 20," Voting Rights Act—1965","  This law authorized federal registrars to register voters and to suspend literacy tests in areas where less than half the eligible minority voters were registered. The impact of this and the Twenty-fourth Amendment was to boost black voter registration in the South from one million in 1964 to three million in 1968."
41, 21," Watts and Other Urban Riots—1965-1968","  In August 1965, just days after the Voting Rights Act was signed, the black Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts exploded in a six-day riot, touched off by the arrest of a black motorist by a white police officer. Thirty-four people were killed, 900 injured, and 4,000 arrested. Millions of dollars of property, mostly businesses in the black neighborhood, were destroyed. In the following summers similar riots broke out in dozens of other Northern cities. According to the Kerner Commission Report, the riots in Northern cities were caused by the frustrated hopes of many blacks, the approval and encouragement of violence by both white and black extremists, and the sense many blacks had of being powerless in a white society. "
41, 22," The Women’s Movement","  While the civil rights movement demanded equal rights for African Americans, women also began demanding equal rights. The spark was a 1963 book The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. Friedan argued that the supposedly ideal life—mother, wife, homemaker—that society had directed women toward was unfulfilling, frustrating, and depressing. Friedan in 1966 co-founded NOW, the National Organization for Women, a group dedicated to eliminating gender discrimination and securing equal rights for women. Another notable figure of the modern women’s movement was Gloria Steinem, a journalist and political activist who co-founded Ms. Magazine and advocated for abortion rights."
41, 23," The Hart-Celler Act—1965","  The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, also known as the Hart-Celler Act, abolished the national origins quota system that had controlled US immigration policy since the 1920’s. It established a new immigration policy based on reuniting immigrant families and attracting skilled labor to the United States. In the thirty years following passage of the Hart-Celler Act, more than 18 million legal immigrants entered the United States, more than three times the number admitted over the preceding thirty years. The growth of immigration from Mexico was especially dramatic. Between 1965 and 2000, the highest number of immigrants (4.3 million) to the U.S. came from Mexico. Immediate relatives of US citizens were not covered by the restriction on the number of visas; once immigrants had naturalized, they were able to sponsor relatives in their native lands in an ever-lengthening migratory process called chain migration."
41, 24," The Warren Court","  Led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Supreme Court in the 1950’s and 1960’s issued a number of landmark rulings. In response, conservatives demanded the impeachment of Warren (never a realistic option in Warren’s case). The Warren Court rulings in several areas contributed to a widening cultural divide between liberals and conservatives. Civil Rights—Brown v. Board of Education desegregated public schools. Rights of the Accused—Miranda v. Arizona required that suspects be informed of their rights. Gideon v. Wainwright ensured that attorneys would be provided to defendants too poor to afford them.  Right to Privacy—Griswold v. Connecticut overturned a state law banning the use of contraceptives, ruling that the Constitution does protect privacy, in this case the right to marital privacy. School Prayer—Engle v. Vitale ended school-sponsored prayer in public schools."
41, 25," Tonkin Gulf Resolution—1964","  In early August of 1964, Johnson reported that North Vietnamese ships had engaged in two separate ““unprovoked attacks”“ on the US destroyer Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin.  The North Vietnamese claimed that the Maddox had been engaged in an attack on its shores (which it was). Johnson urged Congress to give him authority to respond. Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, an authorization ““to take all necessary means to repel any armed attack against forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.”“ This was not a declaration of war, but it gave the president almost unlimited power to expand the conflict.   Johnson used the Tonkin Gulf Resolution to escalate the war by bombing North Vietnam and by increasing the number of American troops to 525,000 in 1967."
41, 26," Operation Rolling Thunder—1965","  In an attempt to force the North Vietnamese to the negotiating table, Johnson began bombing the North. Between 1965 and 1968, the US dropped three times the total tonnage of bombs used by all combatants in WWII. "
41, 27," Hawks and Doves","  Hawks were supporters of the war in Vietnam. They generally based their support on the need to stop communist aggression, on the importance of protecting US national security, and on patriotic support for the president and the troops. Doves were opponents of the war. Their position was based on several factors: The war in Vietnam was a civil war in which the US had no business intervening, the US could not act as the world’s policeman and solve every problem, and the expense of the Vietnam War was draining the resources the country needed for the Great Society’s social programs.  "
41, 28," The Impact of the Tet Offensive—January 1968","  At the end of 1967, the US commander General William Westmoreland told Americans that the North Vietnamese were losing and that the end of the war was near. But in January 1968, the Communists launched the Tet Offensive, attacked cities that the US had considered secure, and killed over 1,100 US troops.  Despite the fact that Tet was a major defeat for the communists in military terms, Americans lost confidence in official announcements of optimism about the war."
41, 29," Credibility Gap","  This term described the perception that what Lyndon Johnson was telling the American people about the war did not match what they were seeing on their television screens. The Tet Offensive increased the size of this gap, as did the later publication of the Pentagon Papers, which revealed that the government had been systematically deceiving the public about the war."
41, 30," Election of 1968","  Opposition to the war was so strong that LBJ decided not to run for reelection. Until his assassination, Robert Kennedy was perhaps the leading contender. With Kennedy gone, Johnson’s vice president Hubert Humphrey won the nomination at a Chicago convention marked by huge antiwar protests and police brutality. The Republicans nominated Richard Nixon who pledged to end the war with honor but provided no details. Independent George Wallace attacked crime, antiwar protestors, civil rights, and Washington bureaucrats. Wallace won 13% of the popular vote. In a very tight race, Nixon defeated Humphrey."
41, 31," The Counterculture","  Insulated from want by a robust economy and dismayed by the war, racism, and materialism, many young people attempted to develop a new set of cultural values based on personal freedom, distrust of authority, a strong sense of community, and environmental awareness.  While drug use and sexual freedom received a good deal of media coverage, it is important to note that only a minority of young people were hippies."
41, 32," Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)","  Separate from the counterculture (though often grouped together in the popular mind), leftist groups such as the SDS emerged from the socialist movement in America. The 1962 Port Huron statement—the manifesto of the SDS—criticized the nuclear arms race, racial discrimination, and corporate power. It called for participatory democracy and nonviolent civil disobedience. The SDS became a leading student group protesting the war in Vietnam."
41, 33," Moon Landing—1969","  JFK started the nation on a race against the Soviets to the moon. The contest cost the US $25 billion. In July of 1969, American Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the moon. Six hundred million people watched on television, the largest audience in television history.   	 Key ID’s Ch. 42, 1968–1980 "
42, 1," Nixon’s Southern Strategy","  Having won the 1968 election by a very narrow margin, Richard Nixon governed in his first term hoping to appeal to Wallace voters. His Southern strategy involved slowing down progress on civil rights, appointing conservatives to the federal courts, and criticizing the Left to appeal to the Silent Majority."
42, 2," Revenue Sharing","  During the Nixon years, Congress was controlled by the Democrats, who generally favored liberal social programs. Nixon advocated a program of revenue sharing—sending federal tax dollars to local governments. Nixon assumed that local governments would spend the money on more conservative causes, e.g., law enforcement. In addition, sending this money out of Washington would reduce the amount available for Congress to spend on liberal programs."
42, 3," Impoundment","  Nixon also sought to limit spending on liberal social programs through impoundment, that is, by refusing to spend money appropriated by Congress. The president’s power to impound funds was limited by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974, which required congressional acquiescence in any such impoundment. "
42, 4," Earth Day—1970","  Spurred by two influential books, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (which warned of the dangers of pesticides and industrial chemicals) and Paul Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb (which forecast environmental disaster as a result of population growth), 20 million Americans gathered in rallies, protests, and celebrations in April 1970. This growing environmental movement put pressure on Congress to pass major environmental legislation.  "
42, 5," Environmental Protection","  National Environmental Policy Act—1969. This law requires federal agencies to prepare environmental impact statements for all proposed projects.  Environmental Protection Agency—1970. Created by consolidating several federal agencies, the EPA was given the responsibility for establishing and enforcing environmental standards regarding air pollution, water pollution, etc.  Clean Air Act—1970. This expanded previous air pollution laws to protect public health, in part by regulating auto emissions.  Endangered Species Act—1973. This law requires the federal government to identify species threatened with extinction and protect both those species and their habitat."
42, 6," My Lai—1968","  At My Lai, a village in Vietnam, US soldiers looking for Vietcong forces killed about 400 old people, women, and children. Although the military tried to hush up the story, it eventually came out. Lt. William Calley was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison; Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1974. News of the massacre further reduced public support for the war."
42, 7," War Powers Act—1973","  Since 1964 presidents Johnson and Nixon had used the Tonkin Gulf Resolution as a basis for waging unlimited war in Vietnam. Seeking to limit the war and to reassert congressional power to declare war, Congress passed the War Powers Act.  This law allows the president to send troops into conflict without congressional authorization. But those troops must be withdrawn in sixty days unless Congress authorizes a longer commitment."
42, 8," Kent State—1970","  Following the news that Nixon had secretly expanded the Vietnam War into Cambodia, protests erupted on many college campuses. At Kent State, protestors threw rocks and firebombed the ROTC building. National Guard troops opened fire and killed four. "
42, 9," Nixon Visits China—1972","  Since China had come under communist control in 1949, the US had refused China diplomatic recognition. Nixon recognized the tensions between China and the Soviet Union and sought to exploit those differences to America’s advantage. By establishing formal relations with the PRC, he hoped to drive a wedge between the two communist powers and play one against the other. In 1972, Nixon, the man who had made his reputation as an implacable foe of communism, visited China and dined with Mao."
42, 10," Détente","  Détente means the reduction of tensions between two nations. Nixon’s trip to China initiated a period of détente with China. Nixon’s China trip was followed by a visit to the USSR where he signed trade and weapons agreements, again beginning a period of détente."
42, 11," Attica Prison Riot—1971","  At Attica Prison in upstate New York, prisoners rioted, took guards prisoner, and demanded improved prison conditions, such as fresh food, a daily shower, and medical attention. The standoff ended four days later when state police launched an all-out assault on orders from Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Forty-three people were killed, eleven of them prison guards, in the attack. "
42, 12," Pentagon Papers—1971","  The Pentagon Papers were a 7,000-page secret history of the war in Vietnam compiled by the Defense Department. Daniel Ellsberg, a civilian employee of the Pentagon, copied the document and leaked it to the New York Times and Washington Post.  The Pentagon Papers showed the public that the government had systematically misled the nation about the nature and extent of US involvement in the war. Publication was one more factor weakening public support for the war."
42, 13," Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II)—1972, 1979","  SALT I was negotiated with the Soviets by President Nixon. It limited the number of antiballistic (defensive) missiles each side could have. This was based on the assumption that the threat of mutually assured destruction would ensure that neither side would launch a nuclear first strike. SALT I was seen as a positive result of détente.  SALT II, negotiated by President Carter, was intended to limit and eventually reduce the number of nuclear missiles (offensive) each side could possess. This treaty was not ratified by the Senate, and when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan later that year, Carter withdrew the treaty from the Senate and instituted several anti-Soviet measures."
42, 14," Allende Overthrown in Chile—1973","  Salvador Allende, a socialist, was elected president of Chile in 1970. He proposed to nationalize several industries where American firms had invested heavily. In addition, his Marxist orientation worried a Nixon administration concerned about containing the spread of communism. The CIA had failed to prevent Allende’s election. It next tried to weaken Chile’s economy to drive Allende from power. When that failed, the CIA supported a military coup that seized power, killed Allende, and initiated sixteen years of military dictatorship."
42, 15," Oil Embargo—1973","  Angered by American support for Israel, Arab members of OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries) imposed an embargo on oil shipments to the US creating a severe shock to the American economy. At the time, the US imported about one-third of its oil (today the US imports half its oil). As a result of the oil shortage, energy prices shot up and inflation hit 23% in 1974-1975. Unemployment reached 11% in 1975."
42, 16," Roe v. Wade—1973","  Beginning in the late 1960’s, some states began removing restrictions on abortion. In Roe, the Supreme Court ruled that a state can impose no restrictions on abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy and can ban abortion completely in the last trimester."
42, 17," Spiro Agnew Resigns—1973","  Agnew, Nixon’s vice president, had been the administration’s voice condemning lawlessness and disorder. He was found to have taken bribes and kickbacks on construction projects while he was governor of Maryland. Accused by prosecutors of political corruption, Agnew plea-bargained and pleaded no contest to income tax evasion in exchange for a sentence that included no jail time."
42, 18," Watergate—1972-1974","  Having barely lost the presidency in 1960 and having barely won it in 1968, Nixon surrounded himself with associates dedicated to making sure that Nixon won in 1972. Those associates authorized a variety of illegal activities, including the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in 1972.  While there is no evidence that Nixon ordered or knew of the burglary in advance, he did order his associates to cover up any White House involvement, claiming initially that the burglary had been a CIA operation. "
42, 19," Saturday Night Massacre—1973","  A special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, was appointed to investigate Watergate. When he sued the president to obtain Oval Office tapes, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliott Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson refused and resigned, as did his assistant William Ruckelshaus. Finally, Solicitor General Robert Bork fired Cox. The result was a firestorm of controversy as much of the nation assumed Nixon had something to hide. The House of Representatives began an impeachment investigation."
42, 20," Executive Privilege","  This is the doctrine that allows a president to refuse Congressional requests for documents, personal testimony, or testimony from the president’s aides. Without such executive privilege, Congress could control the executive branch and weaken the separation of powers. In US v. Nixon, the Supreme Court ruled that executive privilege is valid but that it does not allow the president to withhold evidence in a criminal investigation. This decision required Nixon to turn over his tapes."
42, 21," Ford Pardons Nixon—1974","  Following Nixon’s resignation in August, there was serious consideration of indicting him for crimes relating to Watergate. Hoping to spare the nation the ordeal of several years of Watergate trials, President Ford issued Nixon a full pardon. This pardon was highly unpopular with many Americans and contributed to Ford’s narrow loss to Jimmy Carter in 1976."
42, 22," The End of the War in Vietnam","  In 1973 the US and North Vietnam agreed to a cease fire. The US was to withdraw its troops from South Vietnam though it could continue to send military aid. An election was set to determine future control of a united Vietnam. In 1975 North Vietnam launched an offensive and the South Vietnamese forces quickly collapsed. "
42, 23," Regents of the University of California v. Bakke—1978","  In this case, the Supreme Court declared that affirmative action programs may not impose a strict quota system but may use race, gender, or ethnicity as one factor in choosing among qualified applicants for college admission."
42, 24," Panama Canal Treaty—1977","  In this treaty negotiated by the Carter administration, the US pledged to return the Canal to Panama by the end of 1999. The treaty was very unpopular among conservatives such as Ronald Reagan who felt that America’s national interest should determine US foreign policy."
42, 25," Love Canal","  This canal near Niagara Falls had been the site of chemical dumping for decades. By the late 1970’s, residents were concerned about the toxins and their connection to cancer, birth defects, and other medical problems. In 1978 residents were relocated from the most contaminated areas. Love Canal became the nation’s first Superfund toxic waste cleanup project."
42, 26," Three Mile Island—1979","  A cooling system failure at a nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, led to the nation’s worst nuclear accident. Thousands were evacuated temporarily. Though some radiation was released, there were no deaths directly attributed to the leak. The effect of the accident was to deepen concerns about the safety of nuclear power. No new commercial plants have been ordered constructed since Three Mile Island."
42, 27," Camp David Accords—1978","  In an effort to reduce tensions in the Middle East, Jimmy Carter invited Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the presidential retreat Camp David. Thirteen days of intense personal diplomacy followed, resulting in Israel’s agreement to return to Egypt land taken in the 1967 war and Egypt’s agreement to respect Israel’s borders."
42, 28," US Hostages in Iran—1979","  With the fall of the Shah, America’s ally, Islamic fundamentalists came to power in Iran. When Carter allowed the exiled shah to enter the US for medical care, many Iranians feared a repetition of the CIA coup that had put the shah on the throne in 1953.  In response, a group of Iranians seized the US embassy in Teheran and took a number of Americans hostage. They were held for 444 days and not released until the moment Carter left office. Carter’s inability to resolve the hostage crisis hurt his electoral chances against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election."
42, 29," Grain Embargo & Olympics Boycott—1980","  When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and set up a pro-communist government, Carter responded in several ways. The US provided training to rebel forces fighting the Soviets—including a Saudi fundamentalist named Osama bin Laden who had come to Afghanistan to help free the Islamic state from foreign domination. To express US displeasure, Carter also withdrew the US from the 1980 Olympics, which were held in Moscow. And he imposed an embargo on grain sales to Russia. The embargo angered American farmers.  Key ID’s Ch. 43 and Beyond"
43, 1," American Indian Movement (AIM)","  Influenced by the other protest movements of the 1960’s, Native Americans formed the American Indian Movement in 1967 to protest federal policy toward Native Americans—government corruption on the reservations, broken treaties, and a lack of self- determination. To dramatize their demands, AIM seized and occupied Alcatraz Island (a former federal prison) in 1969, the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington in 1972, and the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota (site of the 1890 massacre) in 1973. The Wounded Knee protest led to a 71-day siege by federal marshals, but the issues which sparked the protests were not resolved."
43, 2," Stonewall Riots—1969","  In June 1969, a group of gay customers at the popular Stonewall Inn gay bar in New York angrily stood up against police harassment; a riot broke out. As word spread throughout the city, the customers of the inn were soon joined by other gay men and women. Police reinforcements arrived and dispersed the rioters, but the next night over 1000demonstrators returned.. For hours, protesters rioted outside the Stonewall Inn, and more demonstrations took place throughout the city in the following days.  After the riots, heated debates about civil rights were held among New York&#39;s LGBT community, leading to the formation of advocacy groups such as the Gay Liberation Front. The first gay pride parade in U.S. history took place on the first anniversary of the riots, near the Stonewall Inn in New York. Within two years gay rights groups had been started in nearly every major city in the United States."
43, 3," AIDS Epidemic","  The disease AIDS was first identified in 1981. Initially it was assumed to be a disease of gay men. This had two effects: research and funding were slower in coming than they might have been for disease affecting other groups, and the actions of gay activists lobbying for more AIDS funding helped to spur the development of the gay rights movement."
43, 4," Mariel Boatlift—1980","  The Carter administration agreed to allow 3500 political refugees from Cuba into the United States. Fidel Castro used this as opportunity to rid the island of malcontents. Castro announced that those who wished to leave Cuba should gather at the port of Mariel near Havana. There they were picked up by boats from Florida. Those fleeing Cuba were not limited to political refugees; Castro used the opportunity to empty jails and insane asylums. Nor were the numbers limited to 3500; 125,000 Cubans flooded into Florida. Carter’s management of this event lost him support in the South."
43, 5," Christian Conservatives","  Although Christian conservatives had traditionally shunned political involvement, after Roe v. Wade and other social changes, they increasingly became active in politics, supporting conservative candidates The Moral Majority—1979-1989. Founded by fundamentalist minister Jerry Falwell, the Moral Majority was a political action group designed to advance the concerns of conservative Christians: support for school prayer and the teaching of creationism; opposition to abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, gay rights, and the SALT agreements.  Focus on the Family. Founded in 1977 by James Dobson, Focus on the Family opposes abortion, divorce, pornography, gambling, and gay rights. It supports traditional gender roles, school prayer, creationism, and abstinence-only sex education."
43, 6," Reagan’s Election and the Modern Conservative Movement—1980","  Liberal policies had dominated American politics since FDR’s election in 1932. Reagan’s election marked the ascendance of conservative values including support for lower taxes, support for traditional moral values (e.g., opposition to abortion and gay rights), support for a strong military, and opposition to government social programs and the spending they required."
43, 7," Equal Rights Amendment Fails—1982","  A proposed constitutional amendment to ban discrimination based on gender was approved by Congress in 1972 and sent to the states. Thirty states voted for the amendment in the first year, but thirty-eight states were needed for final ratification, and increasing opposition to the ERA stalled its progress. Opponents of the ERA led by Phyllis Schlafly charged that the amendment would lead to women in combat, the breakdown of the family, government funding of abortion, and elimination of separate bathrooms for men and women. Although Congress extended the deadline for ratification by three years, the ERA was only approved by thirty-five states."
43, 8," Reaganomics","  Ronald Reagan’s economic program was based on supply-side economics, the theory that if taxes were cut, this would stimulate the economy, putting more people to work, and eventually actually increasing tax receipts. Reagan persuaded Congress to cut income taxes by 25% over three years. Reagan also believed that reducing government regulation of business would stimulate the economy by making businesses more efficient. Carter had begun deregulation; Reagan extended it to savings and loans, transportation, environment, and broadcasting. In addition, Reagan hoped to balance the budget while increasing defense spending. Accordingly, he attempted to cut social programs such as school lunches, job training, and mass transit. The budget was not balanced, and the national debt nearly tripled during the Reagan years."
43, 9," A Nation at Risk Report—1983","  With German and Japanese businesses outperforming US businesses in the 1970’s and 1980’s, education reformers pointed at the nation’s schools as the source of the problem. The report A Nation at Risk argued that the American economy lagged because American schools were of poor quality. Reformers proposed longer school days, a longer school year, and tougher standards for students."
43, 10," The Reagan Doctrine","  Ronald Reagan opposed the policy of détente that presidents since Nixon had followed regarding the Soviet Union. To Reagan, the Soviet Union was the ““Evil Empire;”“ containment was not enough. Instead, Reagan sought to roll back communist control where possible. Based on this doctrine, Reagan supported the anti-Soviet mujahedeen in Afghanistan and the contras in Nicaragua (eventually leading to the Iran-Contra scandal). However, in his second term, Reagan held four summit meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in which they forged a close, if wary, relationship. Eager for a lasting legacy as a  peacemaker, Reagan pursued arms control agreements, even discussing a complete elimination of all nuclear weapons at the 1986 Reykjavik summit."
43, 11," INF Treaty—1987","  This treaty between the US and USSR banned all intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe. This was the first time an entire category of existing weapons had been banned."
43, 12," Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars)","  This was Reagan’s 1983 proposal for a space-based missile defense system. Reagan’s refusal to bargain this away put pressure on the Soviets to try to match US military spending."
43, 13," US Invasion of Grenada—1983","  After a coup brought a leftist government to power on this Caribbean island, Reagan sent US forces to oust the leftists and replace them with a government friendly to the United States."
43, 14," Constructive Engagement in South Africa","  In the 1980’s protests mounted against the apartheid regime in South Africa. Many called for disinvestment from South Africa; for example, some universities got rid of stocks from companies doing business in South Africa. The intent was to put economic pressure on the government to end apartheid. Reagan took a different view, arguing that continued investment in South Africa gave America the opportunity and the leverage to pressure South Africa to change. This approach was called constructive engagement."
43, 15," Iran-Contra—1986","  The US had poor relations with Iran as a result of the 1979 hostage situation. In 1983 the US sent peacekeeping troops to Lebanon. The Islamic group Hezbollah thought the US favored Christian forces and took several Americans hostage. The US thought Hezbollah was under the influence of Iran and sought better relations with Iran as a way of getting the American hostages released. In Nicaragua in 1979, the Sandinistas, a socialist group headed by Daniel Ortega came to power. Concerned about the spread of communism, Reagan opposed the Sandinistas and aided the contras, a group of Nicaraguans attempting to overthrow Ortega. But when Congress learned that the CIA had helped the contras mine harbors and sabotage power plants, it placed a ban on aid to the contras. Oliver North, a member of Reagan’s National Security Council staff, helped organize a plan to aid the contras and recover the hostages. The US sold arms to Iran (Reagan himself had banned any arms sales to Iran because of its support of terrorism) to use against Iraq (America’s ally). The Iranians were grossly overcharged for the weapons, and the extra money was sent to the contras. When this came to light, North took much of the blame. Reagan claimed that he couldn’t remember whether or not he had authorized the operation. Reagan’s standing in opinion polls remained strong."
43, 16," Glasnost &amp; Peristroika","  When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985, he saw the need for reform of the Soviet system. Glasnost means openness. Gorbachev wanted to reduce the secrecy of the USSR and allow greater freedom of speech and political freedom. Peristroika means restructuring. Gorbachev saw the need to implement market reforms to revitalize the sickly Soviet economy.  These changes necessitated a reduction in military spending and an increased focus on the consumer economy. More importantly, these changes helped bring about an end to the Cold War. On Christmas Day, 1991, Gorbachev resigned his office; the following day the USSR was formally dissolved."
43, 17," Tiananmen Square—1989","  A pro-democracy movement in China was crushed by force, killing hundreds, when the Chinese government sent tanks to disperse the student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The Bush administration protested but decided it was better to maintain diplomatic relations with China than to make a stronger protest by breaking relations."
43, 18," Savings &amp; Loan Bailout—1989","  Freed from government regulations, hundreds of savings and loans made unsound loans on speculative real estate deals. Nearly 600 S &amp; L’s went bankrupt, threatening depositors’ savings. The Bush administration set up a fund to repay depositors. The total cost was nearly $500 billion."
43, 19," Fall of the Berlin Wall—1989","  Following the fall of the communist government in Poland, an event brought about by the Solidarity movement, communist governments across Eastern Europe collapsed. The Soviet Union no longer was willing to use force to keep Eastern European communists under control. In December, the Berlin Wall itself was opened to free passage. This was generally seen as the event marking the end of the Cold War."
43, 20," Exxon Valdez—1989","  Although George H.W. Bush had campaigned on the promise to be the ““environmental president,”“ his record on the environment was mixed. Symbolic of this was the Exxon Valdez oil spill. This shipwreck dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s coastal waters, killing thousands of sea birds and severely damaging the fishing industry in the area."
43, 21," US Invasion of Panama—1989","  Concerned about the flow of illegal drugs through Panama, President Bush ordered a US invasion. Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, formerly on the CIA payroll, had been accepting bribes to allow drugs to pass through Panama on the way to the US. Noriega was captured and sentenced to life in prison."
43, 22," Gulf War I—1991","  Iraq’s Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990 in a dispute over oil fields on the border of the two nations. It seemed possible that Iraq could continue into Saudi Arabia, giving Iraq control over almost half of the world’s oil. President Bush assembled a coalition of twenty-eight countries, including a number of Arab states, to oppose Iraq. When sanctions did not faze Iraq, the US-led coalition, with UN approval, attacked in January 1991 and quickly pushed Iraq out of Kuwait. The war restored American confidence, shaky since Vietnam, that it could effectively flex its military muscles overseas."
43, 23," Planned Parenthood v. Casey—1992","  Although this case affirmed the basic right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade, this was seen as a victory for pro-life forces in that it upheld a Pennsylvania law requiring informed consent and a twenty-four hour waiting period before an abortion could be performed. It also upheld a law mandating parental notification before a minor could have an abortion. "
43, 24," Don’t Ask; Don’t Tell—1993","  For decades homosexuals had been barred from serving in the US military. Bill Clinton as a candidate had pledged to lift that ban, but opposition from the military made it difficult to eliminate the ban entirely. Clinton announced a compromise known as Don’t Ask; Don’t Tell. Military officials were not supposed to inquire as to sexual orientation, and homosexuals were allowed to serve in the military so long as they told no one of their sexual orientation. In 2010 the Pentagon concluded that homosexuality posed no threat to military readiness and Congress passed a law allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military."
43, 25," North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)—1994","  NAFTA created a free-trade zone removing most tariffs and trade barriers on trade among the US, Canada, and Mexico. It was controversial among labor unions who feared that US jobs would be shipped to low- wage Mexico and among environmentalists who feared that manufacturing would shift to Mexico where environmental protections were less stringent."
43, 26," The Contract with America—1994","  In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans gained control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in forty years. Credit was given in part to the Contract with America, a set of ten proposals House Republicans promised to support. In general, the ten proposals called for deregulation, tax cuts, reform of social programs, and a balanced budget. Although the House quickly passed nine of the ten, only three of the least controversial measures eventually became law. Still, the Contract represented a change in the policy debate in Washington."
43, 27," Clinton’s Impeachment—1998","  Bill Clinton had been under investigation by a special prosecutor for several years, originally because of a real estate deal in Arkansas on the White River. The deal didn’t pan out, and Clinton lost money, but there were accusations that as a political figure, he had received special favors from a savings and loan. Paula Jones, a state employee in Arkansas when Clinton was governor, accused Clinton of sexual harassment and sued him. At a deposition, Clinton was asked about his relationships with other government employees, including Monica Lewinsky. Clinton denied a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. But evidence emerged of a sexual relationship, and the special prosecutor recommended impeachment to the House of Representatives. The House charged Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate rejected both charges, and Clinton remained in office through the end of his second term. During the impeachment proceedings, Clinton’s public approval ratings soared to nearly 70%, the highest level of his presidency."
43, 28," Bush v. Gore—2000","  In one of the closest elections in American history, Democrat Al Gore won the popular vote and led Republican George W. Bush in the electoral vote. But the results in Florida were in dispute; there were charges that minority voters had been turned away at the polls, that the butterfly ballots were confusing, and that hanging chads (the paper bits punched out on a punch-card ballot) had caused voting machine miscounts. Bush led by about 500 votes. Gore wanted a recount in several counties. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision blocked the recount, saying that a lack of uniform statewide standards for determining what constituted a legal vote violated the equal  protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That is, different counties had different standards for determining ““the clear intent of the voter.”“ Therefore, the recount had to be halted, Bush received Florida’s electoral votes, and he became president."
43, 29," 9/11 Attacks &amp; the Patriot Act—2001","  In the most significant attack on US soil since Pearl Harbor, four airliners were hijacked. Two destroyed the World Trade Center in New York, one hit the Pentagon, and one was forced to crash land by the actions of its passengers. The hijackers, mostly from Saudi Arabia, were members of al Qaeda, headed by Osama bin Laden. One response to the 9/11 attacks was a heightened concern about security. Congress passed the Patriot Act, a sweeping law that expanded government power to conduct electronic surveillance and carry out so-called sneak-and-peek searches where an individual is not notified that the government has searched his or her residence or business. In addition, the Patriot Act authorized the use of national security letters that could require banks, credit agencies, or internet service providers to turn over private information about an individual; those companies could then be barred from revealing the records request."
43, 30," War in Afghanistan—2001-2014","  In retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, in October 2001 the US attacked Afghanistan, a country that had hosted al Qaeda training camps. The US forces, working with various local warlords, quickly defeated the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist group that ruled Afghanistan. However, as the US prepared to invade Iraq, troops were diverted from Afghanistan. It is thought that this diversion may have allowed Osama bin Laden to escape capture. This became America’s longest war as the Taliban made a comeback."
43, 31," Bush Tax Cuts—2001 &amp; 2003","  Clinton’s last four budgets had each produced a surplus. Telling the American people, ““It’s your money; it’s not the government’s money,”“ George W. Bush easily persuaded Congress to pass several large tax cuts which cost about $1.5 trillion over ten years, more than the combined cost of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars during that time period. The national debt more than doubled during that ten-year period."
43, 32," War in Iraq—2003-2011","  Although there was no significant connection between Iraq and the 9/11 attacks, the US soon decided to attack Iraq. The reasons for this war included suggestions that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had supported al Qaeda, the fear that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction, the fact that Saddam was a notorious and brutal tyrant, and the hope that a free Iraq would plant a seed of democracy that would flower and spread through the Middle East. Although the US troops won a quick and decisive victory, the occupation of Iraq soon turned bloody as Sunnis and Shiites battled for control and the US mishandled the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq."
43, 33," Obamacare—2010","  The Affordable Care Act, more widely known as Obamacare, was the largest expansion of federal healthcare programs since Medicare in 1965. Intended to extend health insurance to almost all Americans and to hold down the rise in healthcare costs, Obamacare was extremely controversial, especially due to the individual mandate requiring most individuals to purchase health insurance. Nonetheless, in 2012 the Supreme Court held the individual mandate to be constitutional."
